    <p>I was thinking of a series of dreams<br />
      Where nothing comes up to the top<br />
      Everything stays down where it's wounded<br />
      And comes to a permanent stop<br />
      <br />
      Wasn't thinking of anything specific<br />
      Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams<br />
      Nothing truly very scientific<br />
      Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
      <br />
      Thinking of a series of dreams<br />
      Where the time and the tempo drag<br />
      And there's no exit in any direction<br />
      'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes<br />
      <br />
      Wasn't making any great connections<br />
      Wasn't falling for any intricate schemes<br />
      Nothing that would pass inspection<br />
      I was just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
      <br />
      Dreams where the umbrella is folded<br />
      And into the path you are hurled<br />
      And the cards are no good that you're holding<br />
      Unless they are from another world<br />
      <br />
      In one, the surface was frozen<br />
      In another, I witnessed a crime<br />
      In one, I was running, and in another<br />
      All I seemed to be doing was climb<br />
      <br />
      Wasn't looking for any special assistance<br />
      And not going to any great extremes<br />
      I'd already gone the distance<br />
      Was just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
      <br />
      Dreams where the umbrella is folded<br />
      And into the path you are hurled<br />
      And the cards are no good that you're holding<br />
      Unless they are from another world<br />
      <br />
      I'd already gone the distance<br />
      Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
      Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
      Just thinking of a series of dreams<br />
