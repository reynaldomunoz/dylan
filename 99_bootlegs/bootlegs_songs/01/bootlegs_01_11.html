    <p>Well, I was feelin' sad and kind of blue<br />
      I didn't know what I was gonna do<br />
      The Communists were comin' around<br />
      They was in the air, they were on the ground<br />
      They were all over<br />
      <br />
      So I ran down most hurriedly<br />
      And joined the John Birch Society<br />
      I got me a secret membership card<br />
      Went back to my backyard<br />
      And started looking on the sidewalk<br />
      'Neath the rose bush<br />
      <br />
      Well, I was lookin' everywhere for them gold darned Reds<br />
      I got up in the mornin' and looked under my bed<br />
      Looked behind the kitchen, behind the door<br />
      Even tore loose the kitchen floor, couldn't find any<br />
      <br />
      I looked beneath the sofa, beneath the chair<br />
      Looking for them Reds everywhere<br />
      I looked way up my chimney hole<br />
      Even looked deep inside my toilet bowl<br />
      They got away<br />
      <br />
      I heard some footsteps by the front porch door<br />
      So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor<br />
      I snuck around the house with a huff and hiss and<br />
      &quot;Hands up, you Communist&quot; it was a mail man<br />
      He punched me out<br />
      <br />
      Well, I quit my job so I could work alone<br />
      I got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes<br />
      Followed some clues from my detective bag<br />
      And discovered they was red stripes on the American flag<br />
      Did you know about Betsy Ross<br />
      <br />
      Well, I was sittin' home alone and I started to sweat<br />
      I figured they was in my television set<br />
      I peeked behind the picture frame<br />
      And got a shock from my feet that hit my brain<br />
      Them Reds did it, no one's on the hootin' nanny<br />
      <br />
      Well, I finally started thinkin' straight<br />
      When I run outta things to investigate<br />
      I couldn't imagine doin' anything else<br />
      So now I'm at home investigatin' myself<br />
      Hope, I don't find out too much, good God</p>
