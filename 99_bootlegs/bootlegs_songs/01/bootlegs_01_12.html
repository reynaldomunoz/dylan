    <p>Who killed Davey Moore?<br />
      Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Not I&quot;, said the referee<br />
      &quot;Don't point your finger at me<br />
      I could've stopped it in the eighth<br />
      An' maybe kept him from his fate<br />
      But the crowd would've booed, I'm sure<br />
      At not gettin' their money's worth<br />
      It's too bad that he had to go<br />
      But there was a pressure on me too, you know<br />
      It wasn't me that made him fall<br />
      No, you can't blame me at all&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Who killed Davey Moore?<br />
      Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Not us&quot;, said the angry crowd<br />
      Whose screams filled the arena loud<br />
      &quot;It's too bad he died that night<br />
      But we just like to see a fight<br />
      We didn't mean for him to meet his death<br />
      We just meant to see some sweat<br />
      There ain't nothing wrong in that<br />
      It wasn't us that made him fall<br />
      No, you can't blame us at all&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Who killed Davey Moore?<br />
      Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Not me&quot;, said his manager<br />
      Puffing on a big cigar<br />
      &quot;It's hard to say, it's hard to tell<br />
      I always thought that he was well<br />
      It's too bad for his wife an' kids he's dead<br />
      But if he was sick he should've said<br />
      It wasn't me that made him fall<br />
      No, you can't blame me at all&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Who killed Davey Moore<br />
      Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Not me&quot;, says the gambling man<br />
      With his ticket stub still in his hand<br />
      &quot;My wasn't me that knocked him down<br />
      My hands never touched him none<br />
      I didn't commit no ugly sin<br />
      Anyway, I put money on him to win<br />
      It wasn't me that made him fall<br />
      No, you can't blame me at all&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Who killed Davey Moore<br />
      Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Not me&quot;, says the boxing writer<br />
      Pounding print on his old typewriter<br />
      Sayin', &quot;Boxing ain't to blame<br />
      There's just as much danger in a football game&quot;<br />
      Sayin', &quot;Fist fighting is here to stay<br />
      It's just the old American way<br />
      It wasn't me that made him fall<br />
      No, you can't blame me at all&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Who killed Davey Moore?<br />
      Why an' what's the reason for?<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Not me&quot;, says the man whose fists<br />
      Laid him low in a cloud of mist<br />
      Who came here from Cuba's door<br />
      Where boxing ain't allowed no more<br />
      &quot;I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true<br />
      But that's what I am paid to do<br />
      Don't say 'murder,' don't say 'kill'<br />
      It was destiny, it was God's will&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Who killed Davey Moore<br />
      Why an' what's the reason for?</p>
