    <p>Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man<br />
      So can a woman who passes herself off as a male<br />
      They sang, 'Danny Boy' at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer<br />
      The preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed<br />
      <br />
      It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up<br />
      He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground<br />
      You know what they say about<br />
      Bein' nice to the right people on the way up<br />
      Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down<br />
      <br />
      Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
      Ain't no goin' back<br />
      <br />
      Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names<br />
      Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed<br />
      He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine<br />
      But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed<br />
      <br />
      Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger<br />
      And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn<br />
      in these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion<br />
      Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in<br />
      <br />
      Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
      Ain't no goin' back<br />
      <br />
      There's a retired businessman named Red<br />
      Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head<br />
      He feeds off of everyone that he can touch<br />
      He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash<br />
      He's not somebody that you play around with much<br />
      <br />
      Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is<br />
      She'll do wondrous works with your fate<br />
      Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed<br />
      If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave<br />
      <br />
      Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
      Ain't no goin' back<br />
      <br />
      Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight<br />
      You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors<br />
      How to enter into the gates of paradise?<br />
      No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours?<br />
      <br />
      Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks<br />
      A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks<br />
      They like to take all this money from sin<br />
      Build big universities to study in<br />
      Sing, 'Amazing Grace' all the way to the Swiss banks<br />
      <br />
      Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
      Ain't no goin' back<br />
      <br />
      They got some beautiful people out there, man<br />
      They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue<br />
      They got mystery written all over their forehead<br />
      They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young<br />
      <br />
      They don't believe in mercy<br />
      Judgment on them is something that you'll never see<br />
      They can exalt you up or bring you down main route<br />
      Turn you into anything that they want you to be<br />
      <br />
      Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
      Ain't no goin' back<br />
      <br />
      Yes, I guess I loved him too<br />
      I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill<br />
      Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped<br />
      Struck down by the strength of the will<br />
      <br />
      Ain't nothin' left here partner<br />
      Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid<br />
      From now on, this'll be where you're from<br />
      Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come<br />
      Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade<br />
      <br />
      Ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down<br />
      Ain't no goin' back, oh yeah, oh yeah<br />
