    <p>Old Reilly stole a stallion<br />
      But they caught him and they brought him back<br />
      And they laid him down in the jail house ground<br />
      With an iron chain around his neck<br />
      <br />
      Old Reilly's daughter got a message<br />
      That her father was goin' to hang<br />
      She rode by night and came by morning<br />
      With gold and silver in her hand<br />
      <br />
      When the judge saw Reilly's daughter<br />
      His old eyes deepened in his head<br />
      Sayin', &quot;Gold will never free your father<br />
      The price, my dear, is you instead&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Oh I'm as good as dead,&quot; cried Reilly<br />
      &quot;It's only you that he does crave<br />
      And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all<br />
      Get on your horse and ride away&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &quot;Oh father you will surely die<br />
      If I don't take the chance to try<br />
      And pay the price and not take your advice<br />
      For that reason I will have to stay&quot;<br />
      <br />
      The gallows shadows shook the evening<br />
      In the night a hound dog bayed<br />
      In the night the grounds were groanin'<br />
      In the night the price was paid<br />
      <br />
      The next mornin' she had awoken<br />
      To know that the judge had never spoken<br />
      She saw that hangin' branch a-bendin'<br />
      She saw her fathers body broken<br />
      <br />
      These be seven curses on a judge so cruel<br />
      That one doctor can't not save him<br />
      That two healers cannot heal him<br />
      That three eyes cannot see him<br />
      <br />
      That four ears cannot hear him,<br />
      That five walls cannot hide him,<br />
      That six diggers cannot bury him<br />
      And that seven deaths shall never kill him<br />
