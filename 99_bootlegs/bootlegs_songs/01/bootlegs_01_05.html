    <p>Come around you rovin' gamblers and a story I will tell<br />
      About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well<br />
      His name was Willie O' Conley and he gambled all his life<br />
      He had twenty seven children, yet he's never had a wife<br />
      <br />
      And it's ride Willie ride, roll Willie roll<br />
      Wherever you are gamblin' now, nobody knows<br />
      <br />
      He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards<br />
      Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards<br />
      He had the reputation as the gamblin'est man around<br />
      Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town<br />
      <br />
      And it's ride Willie ride, roll Willie roll<br />
      Wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody knows<br />
      <br />
      Sailin' down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans<br />
      They're still talkin' about that card game on that Jackson Queen<br />
      &quot;I've come to win some money,&quot; gamblin' Willie says<br />
      When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his<br />
      <br />
      And it's ride Willie ride, roll Willie roll<br />
      Wherever you are gamblin' now, nobody knows<br />
      <br />
      Up in the rocky mountains in a town called Cripple Creek<br />
      There was an all night poker game, lasted about a week<br />
      Nine hundred miners had laid their money down<br />
      When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town<br />
      <br />
      And it's ride Willie ride, roll Willie roll<br />
      Wherever you are gamblin' now, nobody knows<br />
      <br />
      But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true<br />
      He supported all his children, and all their mothers too<br />
      He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore<br />
      He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and poor<br />
      <br />
      And it's ride Willie ride, roll Willie roll<br />
      Wherever you are a gamblin' now, nobody knows<br />
      <br />
      When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew<br />
      Whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true<br />
      He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair<br />
      The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair<br />
      <br />
      And it's ride Willie ride, roll Willie roll<br />
      Wherever you are gamblin' now, nobody knows<br />
      <br />
      It was late one evenin' during a poker game<br />
      A man lost all his money, he said &quot;Willie was to blame&quot;<br />
      He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate<br />
      Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights<br />
      <br />
      And it's ride Willie ride, roll Willie roll<br />
      Wherever you are gamblin' now, nobody knows<br />
      <br />
      So all you rovin' gamblers, wherever you might be<br />
      The moral of this story is very plain to see<br />
      Make your money while you can, before you have to stop<br />
      For when you pull that dead man's hand, your gamblin' days are up<br />
