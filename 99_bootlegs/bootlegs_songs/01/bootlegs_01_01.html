    <p>Come you ladies and you gentlemen and listen to my song<br />
      Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong<br />
      Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell<br />
      'Bout an east coast city that you all know well<br />
      It's hard times in the country, livin' down in New York town<br />
      <br />
      Old New York city is a friendly old town<br />
      From Washington Heights to Harlem on down<br />
      There's a-mighty many people an' their millin' all around<br />
      They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down<br />
      It's hard times in the country, livin' down in New York town<br />
      <br />
      Well, the weekend is strong and the rich and the poor<br />
      Get there together in roof an' no more<br />
      Crowdin' up 'bove and crowdin' down below<br />
      And someone disappears, you never even know<br />
      And it's hard times from the country, livin' down in New York town<br />
      <br />
      It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate<br />
      To Rockefeller Plaza n' the Empire State<br />
      Mister Empire sits up as high as a bird<br />
      And Ol' Mister Rockfeller never says a word<br />
      It's hard times from the country, livin' down in New York town<br />
      <br />
      Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to find a job of work<br />
      Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt<br />
      If you got a lot o' money you can make yourself merry<br />
      You only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry<br />
      And it's hard times from the country, livin' down in New York town<br />
      <br />
      Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream<br />
      And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream<br />
      He bought this city on a one-way track<br />
      If I had my way I'd sell it right back<br />
      It's hard times from the country, livin' down in New York town<br />
      <br />
      I'll take all the smog in California<br />
      And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains<br />
      And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines<br />
      It's all much cleaner than the New York kind<br />
      It's hard times in the country, livin' down in New York town<br />
      <br />
      So all you newsy people, spread the news around<br />
      You've listen to my story, you've listen to my song<br />
      You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat<br />
      When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet<br />
      And it's hard times from the country, livin' down in New York town<br />
