    <p>They say, &quot;Eat, drink and be merry, take the bull by the horns&quot;<br />
      I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns<br />
      Everything looks a little far away to me<br />
      <br />
      Gettin' harder and harder to recognize the trap<br />
      Too much information about nothin', too much educated rap<br />
      Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be<br />
      <br />
      Well, the moon's going up like wildfire<br />
      I feel the breath of a storm<br />
      There's something I got to do tonight<br />
      You go inside and stay warm<br />
      <br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart<br />
      <br />
      Just got back from a city, city of red skies<br />
      Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies<br />
      Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear<br />
      <br />
      Madame Butterfly, she lulls me to sleep<br />
      Like an ancient river, so wide and so deep<br />
      She said, &quot;Be easy, baby, ain't nothin' worth stealin' here&quot;<br />
      <br />
      You're the one I've been waitin' for<br />
      You're the one that I desire<br />
      But you must realize first<br />
      I'm not another man you can hire<br />
      <br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart<br />
      <br />
      I hear that hot blooded singer on the bandstand croon, 'Poisoned love'<br />
      Red roses for a blue lady in Memphis in June<br />
      While they're beating the devil out of<br />
      A guy who's wearing a clouded blue wig<br />
      <br />
      I've been to Babylon and I got to confess<br />
      I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness<br />
      What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big<br />
      <br />
      Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine<br />
      Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine<br />
      <br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      Someone's got a hold of my heart<br />
      You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh yeah<br />
