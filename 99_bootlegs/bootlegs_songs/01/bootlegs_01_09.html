    <p>Oh, the age of the inmates, I remember quite freely<br />
      No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen<br />
      Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals<br />
      All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing<br />
      <br />
      From the dirty old mess hall, you march to the brick wall<br />
      Too weary to talk and too tired to sing<br />
      And it's all afternoon you remember your home town<br />
      All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing<br />
      <br />
      Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire<br />
      Stay far from the fence with electricity sting<br />
      And it's keep down your head and stay in your number<br />
      All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing<br />
      <br />
      Oh, it's fare thee well to the deep hollow dungeon<br />
      Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen<br />
      Farewell to the minutes, they threaten you with it<br />
      All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing<br />
      <br />
      It's many a guard that stands around smilin'<br />
      Holdin' his club like he was a king<br />
      Hopin' to get you behind the wood pilin'<br />
      All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing<br />
      <br />
      The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows<br />
      And the wind punched hard to make the wall-sidin' sing<br />
      It's many a night, I pretended to be a-sleepin'<br />
      All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing<br />
      <br />
      As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles<br />
      And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring<br />
      'Til the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the mornin'<br />
      All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing<br />
      <br />
      Oh, some of us will wind up in St.Cloud prison<br />
      And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things<br />
      And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads<br />
      From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing<br />
