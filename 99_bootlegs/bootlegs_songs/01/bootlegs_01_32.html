    <p>Well, it's always been my nature<br />
      To take chances<br />
      My right hand drawing back<br />
      While my left hand advances<br />
      <br />
      Where the current is strong<br />
      And the monkey dances<br />
      To the tune<br />
      Of a concertina<br />
      <br />
      Blood dryin' in my yellow hair<br />
      As I go from shore to shore<br />
      I know what it is<br />
      That has drawn me to your door<br />
      <br />
      But whatever could it be<br />
      Makes you think<br />
      You've seen me before<br />
      Angelina<br />
      <br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      <br />
      His eyes were two slits<br />
      Makin' a snake proud<br />
      With a face that any painter would paint<br />
      As he walked through the crowd<br />
      <br />
      Worshiping a God<br />
      With the body of a woman<br />
      Well endowed<br />
      And the head of a hyena<br />
      <br />
      Do I need your permission<br />
      To turn the other cheek?<br />
      If you can read my mind<br />
      Why must I speak?<br />
      <br />
      No, I have heard nothing<br />
      About the man<br />
      That you seek<br />
      Angelina<br />
      <br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      <br />
      In the valley of the giants<br />
      Where the stars and stripes explode<br />
      The peaches they were sweet<br />
      And the milk and honey flowed<br />
      <br />
      I was only following instructions<br />
      When the judge<br />
      Sent me down the road<br />
      With your subpoena<br />
      <br />
      When you cease to exist<br />
      Then who will you blame?<br />
      I've tried my best to love you<br />
      But I cannot play this game<br />
      <br />
      Your best friend<br />
      And my worst enemy<br />
      Is one and the same<br />
      Angelina<br />
      <br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      <br />
      There's a black Mercedes<br />
      Rollin' through the combat zone<br />
      Your servants are half dead<br />
      You're down to the bone<br />
      <br />
      Tell me, tall man<br />
      Where would you like<br />
      To be overthrown<br />
      In Jerusalem or Argentina?<br />
      <br />
      She was stolen from her mother<br />
      When she was three days old<br />
      Now her vengeance has been satisfied<br />
      And her possessions have been sold<br />
      <br />
      He's surrounded by God's angels<br />
      And she's wearin' a blindfold<br />
      But so are you<br />
      Angelina<br />
      <br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      <br />
      I see pieces of men marching<br />
      Trying to take Heaven by force<br />
      I can see the unknown rider<br />
      I can see the pale white horse<br />
      <br />
      In God's truth name<br />
      Tell me what you want<br />
      And you'll have it of course<br />
      Just step into the arena<br />
      <br />
      Beat a path of retreat<br />
      Up them spiral staircases<br />
      Pass the tree of smoke<br />
      Pass the angel with four faces<br />
      <br />
      Begging God for mercy<br />
      And weepin'<br />
      In unholy places<br />
      Angelina<br />
      <br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      Oh, Angelina<br />
      <br />
      Oh, oh, Angelina<br />
      Oh, oh, Angelina<br />
