    <p>The pawnbroker roared<br />
      Also, so, so did the landlord<br />
      The scene was so crazy, wasn't it?<br />
      Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had<br />
      <br />
      Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?<br />
      Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?<br />
      Why did you have to treat me so bad?<br />
      Did it have to be that way?<br />
      <br />
      Now you stand here expectin' me to remember<br />
      Somethin' you forgot to say<br />
      Yes and you, I see you're still with her<br />
      Well, that's fine 'cause she's comin' on so strange<br />
      Can't you tell?<br />
      <br />
      Somebody had better explain<br />
      She's got her iron chain<br />
      I'd do it but I, I just can't remember how<br />
      You talk to her she's your lover now<br />
      <br />
      I already assumed that we're in the felony room<br />
      But I ain't a judge, you don't have to be nice to me<br />
      But please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat<br />
      You know he keeps on sayin' everythin' twice to me<br />
      <br />
      You know I was straight with you<br />
      You know I've never tried to change you in any way<br />
      You know if you didn't want to be with me<br />
      That you could, didn't have to stay<br />
      <br />
      Now you stand here sayin'<br />
      You forgive and forget<br />
      Honey, what can I say?<br />
      Yes, you, you just sit around<br />
      And ask for ashtrays, can't you reach?<br />
      <br />
      I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech<br />
      With her picture books of the pyramid<br />
      And her postcards of Billy the Kid<br />
      (Why must everybody bow?)<br />
      You better talk to her 'bout it, you're her lover now<br />
      <br />
      Oh, everybody that cares<br />
      Is goin' up the castle stairs<br />
      But I'm not up in your castle, honey<br />
      It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all<br />
      <br />
      I can't even remember El Paso, uh, honey<br />
      You never had to be faithful, I didn't want you to grieve<br />
      Oh, why was it so hard for you<br />
      If you didn't want to be with me, just to leave?<br />
      <br />
      Now you stand here while your finger's goin' up my sleeve<br />
      An' you, just what do you do anyway?<br />
      Ain't there nothin' you can say?<br />
      She'll be standin' on the bar soon<br />
      With a fish head an' a harpoon<br />
      <br />
      An' a fake beard plastered on her brow<br />
      You'd better do somethin' quick<br />
      She's your lover now<br />
