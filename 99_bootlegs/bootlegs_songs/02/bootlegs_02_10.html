    <p>I'm a worried man, got a worried mind<br />
      No one in front of me, no one behind<br />
      There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne<br />
      <br />
      Got white skin, got assassins eyes<br />
      I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies<br />
      I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train<br />
      <br />
      Standin' on the gallows with my head in a noose<br />
      Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose<br />
      <br />
      People are crazy and times are strange<br />
      I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range<br />
      I used to care, but things have changed<br />
      <br />
      This place ain't doing me any good<br />
      I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood<br />
      Just for a second there I thought I saw something move<br />
      <br />
      Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag<br />
      Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag<br />
      Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove<br />
      <br />
      Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too<br />
      Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through<br />
      <br />
      People are crazy and times are strange<br />
      I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range<br />
      I used to care, but things have changed<br />
      <br />
      I've been walking forty miles of bad road<br />
      If the Bible is right, the world will explode<br />
      I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can<br />
      <br />
      Some things are too hot to touch<br />
      The human mind can only stand so much<br />
      You can't win with a losin' hand<br />
      <br />
      Feel like fallin' in love with the first woman I meet<br />
      Puttin' her in a wheel barrow and wheelin' her down the street<br />
      <br />
      People are crazy and times are strange<br />
      I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range<br />
      I used to care, but things have changed<br />
      <br />
      I hurt easy, I just don't show it<br />
      You can hurt someone and not even know it<br />
      The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity<br />
      <br />
      Gonna get low down, gonna fly high<br />
      All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie<br />
      I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me<br />
      <br />
      Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake<br />
      I'm not that eager, not that eager to make a mistake<br />
      <br />
      People are crazy, times are strange<br />
      I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range<br />
      I used to care, but things have changed<br />
