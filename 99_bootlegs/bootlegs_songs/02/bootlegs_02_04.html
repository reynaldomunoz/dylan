    <p>The light in this place<br />
      Is really bad<br />
      It's like being in the bottom<br />
      Of a stream<br />
      <br />
      Any minute now<br />
      I'm expecting to wake up<br />
      From a dream<br />
      <br />
      Miss so much<br />
      The softest touch<br />
      Like the grave of some child<br />
      Who neither wept nor smiled<br />
      I'm hiding my faith in the rain<br />
      <br />
      I've been dreamin' of you<br />
      That's all I do<br />
      And it's driving me insane<br />
      <br />
      Somewhere dawn is breaking<br />
      Light is streaking across the floor<br />
      Church bells are ringing<br />
      I wonder who they're ringing for?<br />
      <br />
      Travel under any star<br />
      You'll see me wherever you are<br />
      <br />
      The shadowy past<br />
      Is so vague and so vast<br />
      I'm sleeping in the balance of pain<br />
      <br />
      I've been dreamin' of you<br />
      That's all I do<br />
      And it's driving me insane<br />
      <br />
      Maybe they'll get me<br />
      Maybe they won't<br />
      But whatever<br />
      It won't be tonight<br />
      <br />
      I wish your hand<br />
      Was in mine right now<br />
      We could go where the moon is white<br />
      <br />
      For years they had me<br />
      Locked in a cage<br />
      Then they threw me<br />
      Onto the stage<br />
      <br />
      Some things just last longer<br />
      Then you thought they would<br />
      And they never ever explain<br />
      <br />
      I'm dreamin' of you<br />
      That's all I do<br />
      And it's driving me insane<br />
      <br />
      Well I eat when I'm hungry<br />
      Drink when I'm dry<br />
      Live my life on the square<br />
      <br />
      Even if the flesh<br />
      Falls off my face<br />
      It won't matter as long as you're there<br />
      <br />
      Feel like a ghost in love<br />
      Underneath the heaven's above<br />
      <br />
      Feel further away<br />
      Than I ever did before<br />
      Feel further than I can take<br />
      <br />
      Dreamin' of you<br />
      That's all I do<br />
      But it's driving me insane<br />
      <br />
      Everything in the way<br />
      Is so shy like the day<br />
      In queer and unusual form<br />
      <br />
      Spirals of golden haze<br />
      Here and there in a blaze<br />
      Like beams of light in a star<br />
      <br />
      Maybe you're here<br />
      Or maybe you weren't<br />
      Maybe you touched somebody<br />
      And got burned<br />
      <br />
      The silent sun<br />
      Has got me on the run<br />
      Burning a hole in my brain<br />
      <br />
      I'm dreamin' of you<br />
      That's all I do<br />
      But it's driving me insane<br />
