    <p>I cross the Green Mountain<br />
      I sit by the stream<br />
      Heaven blazing in my head I<br />
      I dreamt a monsterous dream<br />
      Something came up<br />
      Out of the sea<br />
      Swept through the land of<br />
      The rich and the free<br />
      <br />
      I look into the eyes<br />
      of my merciful friend<br />
      And then I ask myself<br />
      Is this the end?<br />
      Memories linger<br />
      Sad yet sweet<br />
      And I think of the souls in heaven who will be<br />
      <br />
      Alters are burning<br />
      The flames far and wide<br />
      the foe has crossed over<br />
      from the other side<br />
      They tip their caps<br />
      from the top of the hill<br />
      You can feel them come<br />
      All brave blood do spill<br />
      <br />
      Along the dim<br />
      Atlantic line<br />
      The rapper's land<br />
      lasts for miles behind<br />
      the lights coming foreward<br />
      and the streets are broad<br />
      all must yield<br />
      To the avenging God<br />
      <br />
      The world is old<br />
      The world is great<br />
      Lessons of life<br />
      Can't be learned in a day<br />
      I watch and I wait<br />
      And I listen while I stand<br />
      To the music that comes<br />
      from a far better land<br />
      <br />
      Close the eyes<br />
      of our Captain<br />
      Peace may he know<br />
      His long night is done<br />
      The great leader is laid low<br />
      He was ready to fall<br />
      He was quick to defend<br />
      Killed outright he was<br />
      by his own men<br />
      <br />
      It's the last day's last hour<br />
      of the last happy year<br />
      I feel that the unknown<br />
      The world is so dear<br />
      Pride will vanish<br />
      And glory will rot<br />
      But virtue lives<br />
      and cannot be forgot<br />
      <br />
      The bells<br />
      of evening have rung<br />
      there's blasphemy<br />
      on the end of the tongue<br />
      Let them say that I walked<br />
      in fair nature's light<br />
      And that I was loyal<br />
      to truth and to right<br />
      <br />
      Serve God and meet your full<br />
      Look upward beyond<br />
      Beyond the darkness that masks<br />
      the surprises of dawn<br />
      In the deep green grasses<br />
      and the blood stained woods<br />
      They never dreamed of surrendering<br />
      They fell where they stood<br />
      <br />
      Stars fell over Alabama<br />
      And I saw each star<br />
      You're walking in dreams<br />
      Whoever you are<br />
      Chilled as the skies<br />
      Keen as the frost<br />
      And the ground's froze hard<br />
      And the morning is lost<br />
      <br />
      A letter to mother<br />
      came today<br />
      Gunshot wound to the breast<br />
      is what it did say<br />
      But he'll be better soon<br />
      He's in a hospital bed<br />
      But he'll never be better<br />
      He's already dead<br />
      <br />
      I'm ten miles outside the city<br />
      And I'm lifted away<br />
      In an ancient light<br />
      That is not of day<br />
      They were calm they were gloomed<br />
      We knew them all too well<br />
      We loved eachother more than<br />
      we ever dared to tell<br />
