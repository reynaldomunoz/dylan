    <p>Oh, the evening train is rolling<br />
      All along the homeward way<br />
      All my hopes are over the horizon<br />
      All my dreams have gone away<br />
      <br />
      The hillside darkly shaded<br />
      Stars falling from above<br />
      All the joys of earth have faded<br />
      The night's untouched, my love<br />
      <br />
      I'll be here 'til tomorrow<br />
      Beneath a shroud of gray<br />
      I pretend I'm free of sorrow<br />
      My heart is miles away<br />
      <br />
      The dead bells are ringing<br />
      My train is overdue<br />
      To your memory I'm clinging<br />
      I can't escape from you<br />
      <br />
      Well, I hear the sound of thunder<br />
      Roaring loud and long<br />
      Sometimes you got to wonder<br />
      God knows I've done no wrong<br />
      <br />
      How you've wasted all your power<br />
      You threw out the Christmas pie<br />
      Now you're withering like a flower<br />
      You'll play the fool and die<br />
      <br />
      I'm neither sad nor sorry<br />
      I'm all dressed up in black<br />
      I fought for fame and glory<br />
      And you tried to break my back<br />
      <br />
      In the far off sweet forever<br />
      The sunshine peeking through<br />
      We should've walked together<br />
      I can't escape from you<br />
      <br />
      I cannot grasp the shadows<br />
      That gather near the door<br />
      Rainfall around my window<br />
      I wish I'd seen you more<br />
      <br />
      The path is ever winding<br />
      The stars they never age<br />
      The morning light is blinding<br />
      All the world's a stage<br />
      <br />
      Should be the time of gladness<br />
      Happy faces everywhere<br />
      The mystery of madness<br />
      Is propagating in the air<br />
      <br />
      I don't like the city<br />
      Not like some folks do<br />
      Isn't it a pity<br />
      I can't escape from you?<br />
      <br />
      We ploughed the fields of heaven<br />
      Right down to the end<br />
      I hope I can be forgiven<br />
      If any words of mine offend<br />
      <br />
      All our days were splendid<br />
      They were simple, they were plain<br />
      It never should have ended<br />
      I should've kissed you in the rain<br />
      <br />
      I've been thinking things all over<br />
      All the moments full of grace<br />
      The primrose and the clover<br />
      Your ever-changing face<br />
      <br />
      Can't help looking at you<br />
      You made love with god knows who<br />
      Never found a gal to match you<br />
      I can't escape from you<br />
