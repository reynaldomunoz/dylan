    <p>Well, I'm sitting in church in an old wooden chair<br />
      I knew nobody would look for me there<br />
      Sorrow and pity rule the earth and the skies<br />
      Looking for nothing anyone's eyes<br />
      <br />
      Once I had pretty girl, did me wrong<br />
      Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
      <br />
      Snowflakes are falling around my head<br />
      Lord have mercy it feel heavy like lead<br />
      I been hit too hard, seen too much<br />
      Nothing can heal me now but your touch<br />
      <br />
      Once I had a pretty girl, she done me wrong<br />
      Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
      <br />
      Loneliness got a mind of its own<br />
      The more people around the more you feel alone<br />
      I'm chained to the earth like a silent slave<br />
      Trying to break free out of death's dark cave<br />
      <br />
      Once I had a pretty girl, done me wrong<br />
      Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
      <br />
      Boys in the street beginning to play<br />
      Girls like birds flying away<br />
      I'm carrying the roses that were given to me<br />
      And I'm thinking about paradise wondering what it might be<br />
      <br />
      Once I had a pretty girl, she done me wrong<br />
      Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
      <br />
      Go over to London maybe gay Paree<br />
      Follow the river you get to the sea<br />
      I was hoping we could drink from life's clear streams<br />
      I was hoping we can dream life's pleasant dreams<br />
      <br />
      Once I had a pretty girl but she done me wrong<br />
      Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
      <br />
      Well, the weak get weaker and the strong stay strong<br />
      The train keeps rolling all night long<br />
      She looked at me with an irresistible glance<br />
      With a smile that could make all the planets dance<br />
      <br />
      Once I had a pretty girl, she did me wrong<br />
      Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
      <br />
      My house is on fire, burning to the skies<br />
      I thought the rain clouds but the clouds passed by<br />
      When I'm gone you'll remember my name<br />
      I'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame<br />
      <br />
      Once I had a pretty girl but she did me wrong<br />
      Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long<br />
      <br />
      I don't know<br />
