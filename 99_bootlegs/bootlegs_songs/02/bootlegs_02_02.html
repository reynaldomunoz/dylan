    <p>Some of us turn off the lights and we live<br />
      In the moonlight shooting by<br />
      Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark<br />
      To be where the angels fly<br />
      <br />
      Pretty maids all in a row lined up<br />
      Outside my cabin door<br />
      I've never wanted any of 'em wanting me<br />
      Except the girl from the Red River shore<br />
      <br />
      Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried<br />
      To make that girl my wife<br />
      She gave me her best advice and she said<br />
      Go home and lead a quiet life<br />
      <br />
      Well, I been to the east and I been to the west<br />
      And I been out where the black winds roar<br />
      Somehow though I never did get that far<br />
      With the girl from the Red River shore<br />
      <br />
      Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her<br />
      I could never be free<br />
      One look at her and I knew right away<br />
      She should always be with me<br />
      <br />
      Well, the dream dried up a long time ago<br />
      Don't know where it is anymore<br />
      True to life, true to me<br />
      Was the girl from the Red River shore<br />
      <br />
      Well, I'm wearing the cloak of misery<br />
      And I've tasted jilted love<br />
      And the frozen smile upon my face<br />
      Fits me like a glove<br />
      <br />
      Well, I can't escape from the memory<br />
      Of the one I'll always adore<br />
      All those nights when I lay in the arms<br />
      Of the girl from the Red River shore<br />
      <br />
      Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past<br />
      Trapped in the fires of time<br />
      I've tried not to ever hurt anybody<br />
      And to stay out of the life of crime<br />
      <br />
      And when it's all been said and done<br />
      I never did know the score<br />
      One more day is another day away<br />
      From the girl from the Red River shore<br />
      <br />
      Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land<br />
      But I know this is where I belong<br />
      I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love<br />
      And the hills will give me a song<br />
      <br />
      Though nothing looks familiar to me<br />
      I know I've stayed here before<br />
      Once a thousand nights ago<br />
      With the girl from the Red River shore<br />
      <br />
      Well, I went back to see about her once<br />
      Went back to straighten it out<br />
      Everybody that I talked to had seen us there<br />
      Said they didn't know who I was talking about<br />
      <br />
      Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago<br />
      I've had to pull back from the door<br />
      I wish I could have spent every hour of my life<br />
      With the girl from the Red River shore<br />
      <br />
      Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago<br />
      A man full of sorrow and strife<br />
      That if someone around him died and was dead<br />
      He knew how to bring 'em on back to life<br />
      <br />
      Well, I don't know what kind of language he used<br />
      Or if they do that kind of thing anymore<br />
      Sometimes I think nobody ever saw me here at all<br />
      Except the girl from the Red River shore<br />
