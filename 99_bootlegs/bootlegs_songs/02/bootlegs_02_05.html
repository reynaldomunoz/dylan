    <p>Well, I wandered alone through a desert of stone<br />
      And I dreamt of my future wife<br />
      My sword's in my hand and I'm next in command<br />
      In this version of death called life<br />
      <br />
      My plate and my cup are right straight up<br />
      I took a rose from the hand of a child<br />
      When I kiss your lips, the honey drips<br />
      I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
      <br />
      Everyday we meet on any old street<br />
      And you're in your girlish prime<br />
      The short and the tall are coming to the ball<br />
      I go there all the time<br />
      <br />
      Behind every tree, there's something to see<br />
      The river is wider than a mile<br />
      I tried you twice, you can't be nice<br />
      I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
      <br />
      Here come the nurse with money in her purse<br />
      Here come the ladies and men<br />
      You push it all in and you've no chance to win<br />
      You play 'em on down to the end<br />
      <br />
      I'm laying in the sand, getting a sunshine tan<br />
      Moving along, riding in style<br />
      From my toes to my head you knock me dead<br />
      I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
      <br />
      I count the years and I shed no tears<br />
      I'm blinded to what might have been<br />
      Nature's voice makes my heart rejoice<br />
      Play me the wild song of the wind<br />
      <br />
      I found hopeless love in the room above<br />
      When the sun and the weather were mild<br />
      You're as fine as wine, I ain't handing you no line<br />
      I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
      <br />
      All the merry little elves can go hang themselves<br />
      My faith is as cold as can be<br />
      I'm stacked high to the roof and I'm not without proof<br />
      If you don't believe me, come see<br />
      <br />
      You think I'm blue, I think so too<br />
      In my words you'll find no guile<br />
      The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold<br />
      And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
      <br />
      The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold<br />
      I'm gonna have to put you down for a while<br />
