    <p>Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel<br />
      Thin man lookin' at his last meal<br />
      Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield<br />
      For dignity<br />
      <br />
      Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass<br />
      Young man lookin' in the shadows that pass<br />
      Poor man lookin' through painted glass<br />
      For dignity<br />
      <br />
      Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve<br />
      Somebody said that dignity was the first to leave<br />
      I went into the city, into the town<br />
      Into the land of the midnight sun<br />
      <br />
      Searchin' high, searchin' low<br />
      Searchin' everywhere I know<br />
      Askin' the cops wherever I go<br />
      Have you seen dignity?<br />
      <br />
      Blind man breakin' out of a trance<br />
      Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance<br />
      Hopin' to find one circumstance<br />
      Of dignity<br />
      <br />
      I went to the wedding of Mary Lou<br />
      She said I don't want nobody see me talkin' to you<br />
      She could get killed if she told me what she knew<br />
      About dignity<br />
      <br />
      I went down where the vultures feed<br />
      I would've got deeper but there wasn't any need<br />
      I heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men<br />
      And it wasn't any difference to me<br />
      <br />
      Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade<br />
      House on fire, debts unpaid<br />
      Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid<br />
      Have you seen dignity?<br />
      <br />
      Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears<br />
      In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors<br />
      Lookin' into the lost forgotten years<br />
      For dignity<br />
      <br />
      I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues<br />
      Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't Hugh<br />
      He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused<br />
      By dignity<br />
      <br />
      Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand<br />
      Steps goin' down into tattoo land<br />
      I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light<br />
      In the bordertowns of despair<br />
      <br />
      Got no place to fade, got no coat<br />
      I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat<br />
      Tryin' to read a letter to me somebody wrote<br />
      About dignity<br />
      <br />
      Sick man lookin' for the doctors cure<br />
      Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were<br />
      And into every masterpiece of literature<br />
      For dignity<br />
      <br />
      Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind<br />
      Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin<br />
      He bites the bullet and he looks within<br />
      For dignity<br />
      <br />
      Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh<br />
      Dignity never been photographed<br />
      I went into the red, went into the black<br />
      Went into the valley of dry bone dreams<br />
      <br />
      So many roads, so much at stake<br />
      So many dead ends and I'm at the edge of the lake<br />
      Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take<br />
      To find dignity<br />
