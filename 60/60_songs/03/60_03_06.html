    <p>A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers&rsquo; blood<br />
      A finger fired the trigger to his name<br />
      A handle hid out in the dark<br />
      A hand set the spark<br />
      Two eyes took the aim<br />
      Behind a man&rsquo;s brain<br />
      But he can&rsquo;t be blamed<br />
      He&rsquo;s only a pawn in their game</p>
    <p>A South politician preaches to the poor white man<br />
      &ldquo;You got more than the blacks, don&rsquo;t complain.<br />
      You&rsquo;re better than them, you been born with white skin,&rdquo; they explain.<br />
      And the Negro&rsquo;s name<br />
      Is used it is plain<br />
      For the politician&rsquo;s gain<br />
      As he rises to fame<br />
      And the poor white remains<br />
      On the caboose of the train<br />
      But it ain&rsquo;t him to blame<br />
      He&rsquo;s only a pawn in their game</p>
    <p>The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid<br />
      And the marshals and cops get the same<br />
      But the poor white man&rsquo;s used in the hands of them all like a tool<br />
      He&rsquo;s taught in his school<br />
      From the start by the rule<br />
      That the laws are with him<br />
      To protect his white skin<br />
      To keep up his hate<br />
      So he never thinks straight<br />
      &rsquo;Bout the shape that he&rsquo;s in<br />
      But it ain&rsquo;t him to blame<br />
      He&rsquo;s only a pawn in their game</p>
    <p>From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks<br />
      And the hoofbeats pound in his brain<br />
      And he&rsquo;s taught how to walk in a pack<br />
      Shoot in the back<br />
      With his fist in a clinch<br />
      To hang and to lynch<br />
      To hide &rsquo;neath the hood<br />
      To kill with no pain<br />
      Like a dog on a chain<br />
      He ain&rsquo;t got no name<br />
      But it ain&rsquo;t him to blame<br />
      He&rsquo;s only a pawn in their game.</p>
    <p>Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught<br />
      They lowered him down as a king<br />
      But when the shadowy sun sets on the one<br />
      That fired the gun<br />
      He&rsquo;ll see by his grave<br />
      On the stone that remains<br />
      Carved next to his name<br />
      His epitaph plain:<br />
      Only a pawn in their game</p>
