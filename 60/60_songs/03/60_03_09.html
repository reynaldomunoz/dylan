    <p>William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll<br />
      With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger<br />
      At a Baltimore hotel society gath&rsquo;rin&rsquo;<br />
      And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him<br />
      As they rode him in custody down to the station<br />
      And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder<br />
      But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
      Take the rag away from your face<br />
      Now ain&rsquo;t the time for your tears</p>
    <p>William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years<br />
      Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres<br />
      With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him<br />
      And high office relations in the politics of Maryland<br />
      Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders<br />
      And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling<br />
      In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking<br />
      But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
      Take the rag away from your face<br />
      Now ain&rsquo;t the time for your tears</p>
    <p>Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen<br />
      She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children<br />
      Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage<br />
      And never sat once at the head of the table<br />
      And didn&rsquo;t even talk to the people at the table<br />
      Who just cleaned up all the food from the table<br />
      And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level<br />
      Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane<br />
      That sailed through the air and came down through the room<br />
      Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle<br />
      And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger<br />
      But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
      Take the rag away from your face<br />
      Now ain&rsquo;t the time for your tears</p>
    <p>In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel<br />
      To show that all&rsquo;s equal and that the courts are on the level<br />
      And that the strings in the books ain&rsquo;t pulled and persuaded<br />
      And that even the nobles get properly handled<br />
      Once that the cops have chased after and caught &rsquo;em<br />
      And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom<br />
      Stared at the person who killed for no reason<br />
      Who just happened to be feelin&rsquo; that way without warnin&rsquo;<br />
      And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished<br />
      And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance<br />
      William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence<br />
      Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears<br />
      Bury the rag deep in your face<br />
      For now&rsquo;s the time for your tears</p>
