    <p>Come gather 'round friends<br />
      And I'll tell you a tale<br />
      Of when the red iron armpits ran plenty<br />
      But the cardboard filled windows<br />
      And old men on the benches<br />
      Tell you now that the whole town is empty<br />
      <br />
      In the north end of town<br />
      My own children have grown<br />
      Well I was raised on the other<br />
      In the wee hours of youth<br />
      My mother took sick<br />
      And I was brought up by my brother<br />
      <br />
      The iron ore poured<br />
      As the years passed the door<br />
      The drag lines an' the shovels they was a-humming<br />
      Till one day my brother<br />
      Failed to come home<br />
      The same as my father before him<br />
      <br />
      Well a long winter's wait<br />
      From the window I watched<br />
      My friends they couldn't have been kinder<br />
      And my schooling was cut<br />
      As I quit in the spring<br />
      To marry John Thomas, a miner<br />
      <br />
      Oh the years passed again<br />
      And the givin' was good<br />
      With the lunch bucket filled every season<br />
      What with three babies born<br />
      The work was cut down<br />
      To a half a day's shift with no reason<br />
      <br />
      Then the shaft was soon shut<br />
      And more work was cut<br />
      And the fire in the air, it felt frozen<br />
      Till a man come to speak<br />
      And he said in one week<br />
      That number eleven was closin'<br />
      <br />
      They complained, in the east<br />
      They are paying too high<br />
      They say that your ore ain't worth digging<br />
      That it's much cheaper down<br />
      In the South American towns<br />
      Where the miners work almost for nothing<br />
      <br />
      So the mining gates locked<br />
      And the red iron rotted<br />
      And the room smelled heavy from drinking<br />
      And the sad, silent song<br />
      Made the hour twice as long<br />
      As I waited for the sun to go sinking<br />
      <br />
      I lived by the window<br />
      As he talked to himself<br />
      This silence of tongues it was building<br />
      Then one morning's wake<br />
      The bed it was bare<br />
      And I was left alone with three children<br />
      <br />
      The summer is gone<br />
      The ground's turning cold<br />
      The stores one by one they're a foldin'<br />
      My children will go<br />
      As soon as they grow<br />
      Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them   </p>
