    <p>Well, I took me a woman late last night<br />
      I&rsquo;s three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight<br />
      She took off her wheel, took off her bell<br />
      Took off her wig, said, &ldquo;How do I smell?&quot;<br />
      I hot-footed it . . . bare-naked . . .<br />
      Out the window!</p>
    <p>Well, sometimes I might get drunk<br />
      Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk<br />
      Don&rsquo;t hurt me none, don&rsquo;t hurt my pride<br />
      &rsquo;Cause I got my little lady right by my side<br />
      (Right there<br />
      Proud as can be)</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;s out there paintin&rsquo; on the old woodshed<br />
      When a can a black paint it fell on my head<br />
      I went down to scrub and rub<br />
      But I had to sit in back of the tub<br />
      (Cost a quarter<br />
      And I had to get out quick . . .<br />
      Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)</p>
    <p>Well, my telephone rang it would not stop<br />
      It&rsquo;s President Kennedy callin&rsquo; me up<br />
      He said, &ldquo;My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?&rdquo;<br />
      I said, &ldquo;My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot<br />
      Anita Ekberg<br />
      Sophia Loren&rdquo;<br />
      (Put &rsquo;em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)</p>
    <p>Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot<br />
      She yells and hollers and squeals a lot<br />
      Licks my face and tickles my ear<br />
      Bends me over and buys me beer<br />
      (She&rsquo;s a honeymooner<br />
      A June crooner<br />
      A spoon feeder<br />
      And a natural leader)</p>
    <p>Oh, there ain&rsquo;t no use in me workin&rsquo; so heavy<br />
      I got a woman who works on the levee<br />
      Pumping that water up to her neck<br />
      Every week she sends me a monthly check<br />
      (She&rsquo;s a humdinger<br />
      Folk singer<br />
      Dead ringer<br />
      For a thing-a-muh jigger)</p>
    <p>Late one day in the middle of the week<br />
      Eyes were closed I was half asleep<br />
      I chased me a woman up the hill<br />
      Right in the middle of an air-raid drill<br />
      It was Little Bo Peep!<br />
      (I jumped a fallout shelter<br />
      I jumped a bean stalk<br />
      I jumped a Ferris wheel)</p>
    <p>Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote<br />
      He&rsquo;s a-runnin&rsquo; for office on the ballot note<br />
      He&rsquo;s out there preachin&rsquo; in front of the steeple<br />
      Tellin&rsquo; me he loves all kinds-a people<br />
      (He&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; bagels<br />
      He&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; pizza<br />
      He&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; chitlins<br />
      He&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; bullshit!)</p>
    <p>Oh, set me down on a television floor<br />
      I&rsquo;ll flip the channel to number four<br />
      Out of the shower comes a grown-up man<br />
      With a bottle of hair oil in his hand<br />
      (It&rsquo;s that greasy kid stuff<br />
      What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is<br />
      What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner<br />
      Charles de Gaulle<br />
      And Robert Louis Stevenson?)</p>
    <p>Well, the funniest woman I ever seen<br />
      Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean<br />
      She takes about fifteen baths a day<br />
      Wants me to grow a cigar on my face<br />
      (She&rsquo;s a little bit heavy!)</p>
    <p>Well, ask me why I&rsquo;m drunk alla time<br />
      It levels my head and eases my mind<br />
      I just walk along and stroll and sing<br />
      I see better days and I do better things<br />
      (I catch dinosaurs<br />
      I make love to Elizabeth Taylor . . .<br />
      Catch hell from Richard Burton!)</p>
