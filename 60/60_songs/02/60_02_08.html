    <p>While riding on a train goin&rsquo; west<br />
      I fell asleep for to take my rest<br />
      I dreamed a dream that made me sad<br />
      Concerning myself and the first few friends I had</p>
    <p>With half-damp eyes I stared to the room<br />
      Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon<br />
      Where we together weathered many a storm<br />
      Laughin&rsquo; and singin&rsquo; till the early hours of the morn</p>
    <p>By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung<br />
      Our words were told, our songs were sung<br />
      Where we longed for nothin&rsquo; and were quite satisfied<br />
      Talkin&rsquo; and a-jokin&rsquo; about the world outside</p>
    <p>With haunted hearts through the heat and cold<br />
      We never thought we could ever get old<br />
      We thought we could sit forever in fun<br />
      But our chances really was a million to one</p>
    <p>As easy it was to tell black from white<br />
      It was all that easy to tell wrong from right<br />
      And our choices were few and the thought never hit<br />
      That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split</p>
    <p>How many a year has passed and gone<br />
      And many a gamble has been lost and won<br />
      And many a road taken by many a friend<br />
      And each one I&rsquo;ve never seen again</p>
    <p>I wish, I wish, I wish in vain<br />
      That we could sit simply in that room again<br />
      Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat<br />
      I&rsquo;d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that</p>
