    <p>Some time ago a crazy dream came to me<br />
      I dreamt I was walkin&rsquo; into World War Three<br />
      I went to the doctor the very next day<br />
      To see what kinda words he could say<br />
      He said it was a bad dream<br />
      I wouldn&rsquo;t worry &rsquo;bout it none, though<br />
      They were my own dreams and they&rsquo;re only in my head</p>
    <p>I said, &ldquo;Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain&rdquo;<br />
      He said, &ldquo;Nurse, get your pad, this boy&rsquo;s insane&rdquo;<br />
      He grabbed my arm, I said, &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;<br />
      As I landed on the psychiatric couch<br />
      He said, &ldquo;Tell me about it&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, the whole thing started at 3 o&rsquo;clock fast<br />
      It was all over by quarter past<br />
      I was down in the sewer with some little lover<br />
      When I peeked out from a manhole cover<br />
      Wondering who turned the lights on</p>
    <p>Well, I got up and walked around<br />
      And up and down the lonesome town<br />
      I stood a-wondering which way to go<br />
      I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road<br />
      It was a normal day</p>
    <p>Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell<br />
      And I leaned my head and I gave a yell<br />
      &ldquo;Give me a string bean, I&rsquo;m a hungry man&rdquo;<br />
      A shotgun fired and away I ran<br />
      I don&rsquo;t blame them too much though, I know I look funny</p>
    <p>Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand<br />
      I seen a man<br />
      I said, &ldquo;Howdy friend, I guess there&rsquo;s just us two&rdquo;<br />
      He screamed a bit and away he flew<br />
      Thought I was a Communist</p>
    <p>Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave<br />
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and play Adam and Eve&rdquo;<br />
      I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin&rsquo;<br />
      When she said, &ldquo;Hey man, you crazy or sumpin&rsquo;<br />
      You see what happened last time they started&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown<br />
      And there was nobody aroun&rsquo;<br />
      I got into the driver&rsquo;s seat<br />
      And I drove down 42nd Street<br />
      In my Cadillac. Good car to drive after a war</p>
    <p>Well, I remember seein&rsquo; some ad<br />
      So I turned on my Conelrad<br />
      But I didn&rsquo;t pay my Con Ed bill<br />
      So the radio didn&rsquo;t work so well<br />
      Turned on my record player—<br />
      It was Rock-a-day Johnny singin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa<br />
      Our Love&rsquo;s A-gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I was feelin&rsquo; kinda lonesome and blue<br />
      I needed somebody to talk to<br />
      So I called up the operator of time<br />
      Just to hear a voice of some kind<br />
      &ldquo;When you hear the beep it will be three o&rsquo;clock&rdquo;<br />
      She said that for over an hour<br />
      And I hung up</p>
    <p>Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then<br />
      Sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;ve been havin&rsquo; the same old dreams<br />
      But mine was a little different you see<br />
      I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me<br />
      I didn&rsquo;t see you around&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, now time passed and now it seems<br />
      Everybody&rsquo;s having them dreams<br />
      Everybody sees themselves<br />
      Walkin&rsquo; around with no one else<br />
      Half of the people can be part right all of the time<br />
      Some of the people can be all right part of the time<br />
      But all of the people can&rsquo;t be all right all of the time<br />
      I think Abraham Lincoln said that<br />
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours&rdquo;<br />
      I said that</p>
