    <p>Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration<br />
      The birdies were flying from tree to tree<br />
      There was little to say, there was no conversation<br />
      As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree<br />
      And the locusts sang off in the distance<br />
      Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody<br />
      Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance<br />
      Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me</p>
    <p>I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking<br />
      Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb<br />
      I was ready to leave, I was already walkin&rsquo;<br />
      But the next time I looked there was light in the room<br />
      And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill<br />
      Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody<br />
      Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill<br />
      Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me</p>
    <p>Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin&rsquo;<br />
      The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees<br />
      The man standin&rsquo; next to me, his head was exploding<br />
      Well, I was prayin&rsquo; the pieces wouldn&rsquo;t fall on me<br />
      Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance<br />
      Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody<br />
      Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance<br />
      And the locusts sang and they were singing for me</p>
    <p>I put down my robe, picked up my diploma<br />
      Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive<br />
      Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota<br />
      Sure was glad to get out of there alive<br />
      And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill<br />
      Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody<br />
      And the locusts sang with a high whinin&rsquo; trill<br />
      Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me<br />
      Singing for me, well, singing for me</p>
