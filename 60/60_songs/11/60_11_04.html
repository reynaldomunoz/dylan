    <p>Went to see the gypsy<br />
      Stayin&rsquo; in a big hotel<br />
      He smiled when he saw me coming<br />
      And he said, &ldquo;Well, well, well&rdquo;<br />
      His room was dark and crowded<br />
      Lights were low and dim<br />
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he said to me<br />
      I said it back to him</p>
    <p>I went down to the lobby<br />
      To make a small call out<br />
      A pretty dancing girl was there<br />
      And she began to shout<br />
      &ldquo;Go on back to see the gypsy<br />
      He can move you from the rear<br />
      Drive you from your fear<br />
      Bring you through the mirror<br />
      He did it in Las Vegas<br />
      And he can do it here&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Outside the lights were shining<br />
      On the river of tears<br />
      I watched them from the distance<br />
      With music in my ears</p>
    <p>I went back to see the gypsy<br />
      It was nearly early dawn<br />
      The gypsy&rsquo;s door was open wide<br />
      But the gypsy was gone<br />
      And that pretty dancing girl<br />
      She could not be found<br />
      So I watched that sun come rising<br />
      From that little Minnesota town</p>
