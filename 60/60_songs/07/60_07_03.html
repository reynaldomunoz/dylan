   <div id="song">
    <p>Ain&rsquo;t it just like the night to play tricks when you&rsquo;re tryin' to be so quiet?<br />
      We sit here stranded, though we&rsquo;re all doin&rsquo; our best to deny it<br />
      And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin&rsquo; you to defy it<br />
      Lights flicker from the opposite loft<br />
      In this room the heat pipes just cough<br />
      The country music station plays soft<br />
      But there&rsquo;s nothing, really nothing to turn off<br />
      Just Louise and her lover so entwined<br />
      And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind</p>
    <p>In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman&rsquo;s bluff with the key chain<br />
      And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the &ldquo;D&rdquo; train<br />
      We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight<br />
      Ask himself if it&rsquo;s him or them that&rsquo;s really insane<br />
      Louise, she&rsquo;s all right, she&rsquo;s just near<br />
      She&rsquo;s delicate and seems like the mirror<br />
      But she just makes it all too concise and too clear<br />
      That Johanna&rsquo;s not here<br />
      The ghost of &rsquo;lectricity howls in the bones of her face<br />
      Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place</p>
    <p>Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously<br />
      He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously<br />
      And when bringing her name up<br />
      He speaks of a farewell kiss to me<br />
      He&rsquo;s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all<br />
      Muttering small talk at the wall while I&rsquo;m in the hall<br />
      How can I explain?<br />
      Oh, it&rsquo;s so hard to get on<br />
      And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn</p>
    <p>Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial<br />
      Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while<br />
      But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues<br />
      You can tell by the way she smiles<br />
      See the primitive wallflower freeze<br />
      When the jelly-faced women all sneeze<br />
      Hear the one with the mustache say, &ldquo;Jeeze<br />
      I can&rsquo;t find my knees&rdquo;<br />
      Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule<br />
      But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel</p>
    <p>The peddler now speaks to the countess who&rsquo;s pretending to care for him<br />
      Sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Name me someone that&rsquo;s not a parasite and I&rsquo;ll go out and say a prayer for him&rdquo;<br />
      But like Louise always says<br />
      &ldquo;Ya can&rsquo;t look at much, can ya man?&rdquo;<br />
      As she, herself, prepares for him<br />
      And Madonna, she still has not showed<br />
      We see this empty cage now corrode<br />
      Where her cape of the stage once had flowed<br />
      The fiddler, he now steps to the road<br />
      He writes ev&rsquo;rything&rsquo;s been returned which was owed<br />
      On the back of the fish truck that loads<br />
      While my conscience explodes<br />
      The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain<br />
      And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain</p>
