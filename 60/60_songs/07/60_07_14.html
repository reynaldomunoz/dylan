    Sad-Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands</div>

   <div id="song">
    <p>With your mercury mouth in the missionary times<br />
      And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes<br />
      And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes<br />
      Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?<br />
      With your pockets well protected at last<br />
      And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass<br />
      And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass<br />
      Who among them do they think could carry you?<br />
      Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands<br />
      Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes<br />
      My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums<br />
      Should I leave them by your gate<br />
      Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?</p>
    <p>With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace<br />
      And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace<br />
      And your basement clothes and your hollow face<br />
      Who among them can think he could outguess you?<br />
      With your silhouette when the sunlight dims<br />
      Into your eyes where the moonlight swims<br />
      And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns<br />
      Who among them would try to impress you?<br />
      Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands<br />
      Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes<br />
      My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums<br />
      Should I leave them by your gate<br />
      Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?</p>
    <p>The kings of Tyrus with their convict list<br />
      Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss<br />
      And you wouldn&rsquo;t know it would happen like this<br />
      But who among them really wants just to kiss you?<br />
      With your childhood flames on your midnight rug<br />
      And your Spanish manners and your mother&rsquo;s drugs<br />
      And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs<br />
      Who among them do you think could resist you?<br />
      Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands<br />
      Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes<br />
      My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums<br />
      Should I leave them by your gate<br />
      Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?</p>
    <p>Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide<br />
      To show you the dead angels that they used to hide<br />
      But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?<br />
      Oh, how could they ever mistake you?<br />
      They wished you&rsquo;d accepted the blame for the farm<br />
      But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm<br />
      And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms<br />
      How could they ever, ever persuade you?<br />
      Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands<br />
      Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes<br />
      My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums<br />
      Should I leave them by your gate<br />
      Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?</p>
    <p>With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row<br />
      And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go<br />
      And your gentleness now, which you just can&rsquo;t help but show<br />
      Who among them do you think would employ you?<br />
      Now you stand with your thief, you&rsquo;re on his parole<br />
      With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold<br />
      And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul<br />
      Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?<br />
      Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands<br />
      Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes<br />
      My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums<br />
      Should I leave them by your gate<br />
      Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?</p>
