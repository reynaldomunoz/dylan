    <p>When she said<br />
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your words, they&rsquo;re just lies&rdquo;<br />
      I cried she was deaf<br />
      And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes<br />
      Then said, &ldquo;What else you got left?&rdquo;<br />
      It was then that I got up to leave<br />
      But she said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget<br />
      Everybody must give something back<br />
      For something they get&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I stood there and hummed<br />
      I tapped on her drum and asked her how come<br />
      And she buttoned her boot<br />
      And straightened her suit<br />
      Then she said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get cute&rdquo;<br />
      So I forced my hands in my pockets<br />
      And felt with my thumbs<br />
      And gallantly handed her<br />
      My very last piece of gum</p>
    <p>She threw me outside<br />
      I stood in the dirt where ev&rsquo;ryone walked<br />
      And after finding I&rsquo;d<br />
      Forgotten my shirt<br />
      I went back and knocked<br />
      I waited in the hallway, she went to get it<br />
      And I tried to make sense<br />
      Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair<br />
      That leaned up against . . .</p>
    <p>Her Jamaican rum<br />
      And when she did come, I asked her for some<br />
      She said, &ldquo;No, dear&rdquo;<br />
      I said, &ldquo;Your words aren&rsquo;t clear<br />
      You&rsquo;d better spit out your gum&rdquo;<br />
      She screamed till her face got so red<br />
      Then she fell on the floor<br />
      And I covered her up and then<br />
      Thought I&rsquo;d go look through her drawer</p>
    <p>And when I was through<br />
      I filled up my shoe<br />
      And brought it to you<br />
      And you, you took me in<br />
      You loved me then<br />
      You didn&rsquo;t waste time<br />
      And I, I never took much<br />
      I never asked for your crutch<br />
      Now don&rsquo;t ask for mine</p>
