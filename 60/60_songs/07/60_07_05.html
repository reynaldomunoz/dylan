    <p>The guilty undertaker sighs<br />
      The lonesome organ grinder cries<br />
      The silver saxophones say I should refuse you<br />
      The cracked bells and washed-out horns<br />
      Blow into my face with scorn<br />
      But it&rsquo;s not that way<br />
      I wasn&rsquo;t born to lose you</p>
    <p>I want you, I want you<br />
      I want you so bad<br />
      Honey, I want you</p>
    <p>The drunken politician leaps<br />
      Upon the street where mothers weep<br />
      And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you<br />
      And I wait for them to interrupt<br />
      Me drinkin&rsquo; from my broken cup<br />
      And ask me to<br />
      Open up the gate for you</p>
    <p>I want you, I want you<br />
      I want you so bad<br />
      Honey, I want you</p>
    <p>How all my fathers, they&rsquo;ve gone down<br />
      True love they&rsquo;ve been without it<br />
      But all their daughters put me down<br />
      &rsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t think about it</p>
    <p>Well, I return to the Queen of Spades<br />
      And talk with my chambermaid<br />
      She knows that I&rsquo;m not afraid to look at her<br />
      She is good to me<br />
      And there&rsquo;s nothing she doesn&rsquo;t see<br />
      She knows where I&rsquo;d like to be<br />
      But it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
    <p>I want you, I want you<br />
      I want you so bad<br />
      Honey, I want you</p>
    <p>Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit<br />
      He spoke to me, I took his flute<br />
      No, I wasn&rsquo;t very cute to him, was I?<br />
      But I did it, though, because he lied<br />
      Because he took you for a ride<br />
      And because time was on his side<br />
      And because I . . .</p>
    <p>I want you, I want you<br />
      I want you so bad<br />
      Honey, I want you</p>
