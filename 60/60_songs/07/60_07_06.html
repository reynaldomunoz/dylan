    <p>Oh, the ragman draws circles<br />
      Up and down the block<br />
      I&rsquo;d ask him what the matter was<br />
      But I know that he don&rsquo;t talk<br />
      And the ladies treat me kindly<br />
      And furnish me with tape<br />
      But deep inside my heart<br />
      I know I can&rsquo;t escape<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
    <p>Well, Shakespeare, he&rsquo;s in the alley<br />
      With his pointed shoes and his bells<br />
      Speaking to some French girl<br />
      Who says she knows me well<br />
      And I would send a message<br />
      To find out if she&rsquo;s talked<br />
      But the post office has been stolen<br />
      And the mailbox is locked<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
    <p>Mona tried to tell me<br />
      To stay away from the train line<br />
      She said that all the railroad men<br />
      Just drink up your blood like wine<br />
      An&rsquo; I said, &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that<br />
      But then again, there&rsquo;s only one I&rsquo;ve met<br />
      An&rsquo; he just smoked my eyelids<br />
      An&rsquo; punched my cigarette&rdquo;<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
    <p>Grandpa died last week<br />
      And now he&rsquo;s buried in the rocks<br />
      But everybody still talks about<br />
      How badly they were shocked<br />
      But me, I expected it to happen<br />
      I knew he&rsquo;d lost control<br />
      When he built a fire on Main Street<br />
      And shot it full of holes<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
    <p>Now the senator came down here<br />
      Showing ev&rsquo;ryone his gun<br />
      Handing out free tickets<br />
      To the wedding of his son<br />
      An&rsquo; me, I nearly got busted<br />
      An&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t it be my luck<br />
      To get caught without a ticket<br />
      And be discovered beneath a truck<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
    <p>Now the preacher looked so baffled<br />
      When I asked him why he dressed<br />
      With twenty pounds of headlines<br />
      Stapled to his chest<br />
      But he cursed me when I proved it to him<br />
      Then I whispered, &ldquo;Not even you can hide<br />
      You see, you&rsquo;re just like me<br />
      I hope you&rsquo;re satisfied&rdquo;<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
    <p>Now the rainman gave me two cures<br />
      Then he said, &ldquo;Jump right in&rdquo;<br />
      The one was Texas medicine<br />
      The other was just railroad gin<br />
      An&rsquo; like a fool I mixed them<br />
      An&rsquo; it strangled up my mind<br />
      An&rsquo; now people just get uglier<br />
      An&rsquo; I have no sense of time<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
    <p>When Ruthie says come see her<br />
      In her honky-tonk lagoon<br />
      Where I can watch her waltz for free<br />
      &rsquo;Neath her Panamanian moon<br />
      An&rsquo; I say, &ldquo;Aw come on now<br />
      You must know about my debutante&rdquo;<br />
      An&rsquo; she says, &ldquo;Your debutante just knows what you need<br />
      But I know what you want&rdquo;<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
    <p>Now the bricks lay on Grand Street<br />
      Where the neon madmen climb<br />
      They all fall there so perfectly<br />
      It all seems so well timed<br />
      An&rsquo; here I sit so patiently<br />
      Waiting to find out what price<br />
      You have to pay to get out of<br />
      Going through all these things twice<br />
      Oh, Mama, can this really be the end<br />
      To be stuck inside of Mobile<br />
      With the Memphis blues again</p>
