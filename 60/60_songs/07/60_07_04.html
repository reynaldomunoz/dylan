    <p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to treat you so bad<br />
      You shouldn&rsquo;t take it so personal<br />
      I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you so sad<br />
      You just happened to be there, that&rsquo;s all<br />
      When I saw you say &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; to your friend and smile<br />
      I thought that it was well understood<br />
      That you&rsquo;d be comin&rsquo; back in a little while<br />
      I didn&rsquo;t know that you were sayin&rsquo; &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; for good</p>
    <p>But, sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
      You just did what you&rsquo;re supposed to do<br />
      Sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
      That I really did try to get close to you</p>
    <p>I couldn&rsquo;t see what you could show me<br />
      Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid<br />
      I couldn&rsquo;t see how you could know me<br />
      But you said you knew me and I believed you did<br />
      When you whispered in my ear<br />
      And asked me if I was leavin&rsquo; with you or her<br />
      I didn&rsquo;t realize just what I did hear<br />
      I didn&rsquo;t realize how young you were</p>
    <p>But, sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
      You just did what you&rsquo;re supposed to do<br />
      Sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
      That I really did try to get close to you</p>
    <p>I couldn&rsquo;t see when it started snowin&rsquo;<br />
      Your voice was all that I heard<br />
      I couldn&rsquo;t see where we were goin&rsquo;<br />
      But you said you knew an&rsquo; I took your word<br />
      And then you told me later, as I apologized<br />
      That you were just kiddin&rsquo; me, you weren&rsquo;t really from the farm<br />
      An&rsquo; I told you, as you clawed out my eyes<br />
      That I never really meant to do you any harm</p>
    <p>But, sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
      You just did what you&rsquo;re supposed to do<br />
      Sooner or later, one of us must know<br />
      That I really did try to get close to you</p>
