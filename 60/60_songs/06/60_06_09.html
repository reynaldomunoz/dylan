    <p>They&rsquo;re selling postcards of the hanging<br />
      They&rsquo;re painting the passports brown<br />
      The beauty parlor is filled with sailors<br />
      The circus is in town<br />
      Here comes the blind commissioner<br />
      They&rsquo;ve got him in a trance<br />
      One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker<br />
      The other is in his pants<br />
      And the riot squad they&rsquo;re restless<br />
      They need somewhere to go<br />
      As Lady and I look out tonight<br />
      From Desolation Row</p>
    <p>Cinderella, she seems so easy<br />
      &ldquo;It takes one to know one,&rdquo; she smiles<br />
      And puts her hands in her back pockets<br />
      Bette Davis style<br />
      And in comes Romeo, he&rsquo;s moaning<br />
      &ldquo;You Belong to Me I Believe&rdquo;<br />
      And someone says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the wrong place my friend<br />
      You better leave&rdquo;<br />
      And the only sound that&rsquo;s left<br />
      After the ambulances go<br />
      Is Cinderella sweeping up<br />
      On Desolation Row</p>
    <p>Now the moon is almost hidden<br />
      The stars are beginning to hide<br />
      The fortune-telling lady<br />
      Has even taken all her things inside<br />
      All except for Cain and Abel<br />
      And the hunchback of Notre Dame<br />
      Everybody is making love<br />
      Or else expecting rain<br />
      And the Good Samaritan, he&rsquo;s dressing<br />
      He&rsquo;s getting ready for the show<br />
      He&rsquo;s going to the carnival tonight<br />
      On Desolation Row</p>
    <p>Now Ophelia, she&rsquo;s &rsquo;neath the window<br />
      For her I feel so afraid<br />
      On her twenty-second birthday<br />
      She already is an old maid<br />
      To her, death is quite romantic<br />
      She wears an iron vest<br />
      Her profession&rsquo;s her religion<br />
      Her sin is her lifelessness<br />
      And though her eyes are fixed upon<br />
      Noah&rsquo;s great rainbow<br />
      She spends her time peeking<br />
      Into Desolation Row</p>
    <p>Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood<br />
      With his memories in a trunk<br />
      Passed this way an hour ago<br />
      With his friend, a jealous monk<br />
      He looked so immaculately frightful<br />
      As he bummed a cigarette<br />
      Then he went off sniffing drainpipes<br />
      And reciting the alphabet<br />
      Now you would not think to look at him<br />
      But he was famous long ago<br />
      For playing the electric violin<br />
      On Desolation Row</p>
    <p>Dr. Filth, he keeps his world<br />
      Inside of a leather cup<br />
      But all his sexless patients<br />
      They&rsquo;re trying to blow it up<br />
      Now his nurse, some local loser<br />
      She&rsquo;s in charge of the cyanide hole<br />
      And she also keeps the cards that read<br />
      &ldquo;Have Mercy on His Soul&rdquo;<br />
      They all play on pennywhistles<br />
      You can hear them blow<br />
      If you lean your head out far enough<br />
      From Desolation Row</p>
    <p>Across the street they&rsquo;ve nailed the curtains<br />
      They&rsquo;re getting ready for the feast<br />
      The Phantom of the Opera<br />
      A perfect image of a priest<br />
      They&rsquo;re spoonfeeding Casanova<br />
      To get him to feel more assured<br />
      Then they&rsquo;ll kill him with self-confidence<br />
      After poisoning him with words<br />
      And the Phantom&rsquo;s shouting to skinny girls<br />
      &ldquo;Get Outa Here If You Don&rsquo;t Know<br />
      Casanova is just being punished for going<br />
      To Desolation Row&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Now at midnight all the agents<br />
      And the superhuman crew<br />
      Come out and round up everyone<br />
      That knows more than they do<br />
      Then they bring them to the factory<br />
      Where the heart-attack machine<br />
      Is strapped across their shoulders<br />
      And then the kerosene<br />
      Is brought down from the castles<br />
      By insurance men who go<br />
      Check to see that nobody is escaping<br />
      To Desolation Row</p>
    <p>Praise be to Nero&rsquo;s Neptune<br />
      The Titanic sails at dawn<br />
      And everybody&rsquo;s shouting<br />
      &ldquo;Which Side Are You On?&rdquo;<br />
      And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot<br />
      Fighting in the captain&rsquo;s tower<br />
      While calypso singers laugh at them<br />
      And fishermen hold flowers<br />
      Between the windows of the sea<br />
      Where lovely mermaids flow<br />
      And nobody has to think too much<br />
      About Desolation Row</p>
    <p>Yes, I received your letter yesterday<br />
      (About the time the doorknob broke)<br />
      When you asked how I was doing<br />
      Was that some kind of joke?<br />
      All these people that you mention<br />
      Yes, I know them, they&rsquo;re quite lame<br />
      I had to rearrange their faces<br />
      And give them all another name<br />
      Right now I can&rsquo;t read too good<br />
      Don&rsquo;t send me no more letters, no<br />
      Not unless you mail them<br />
      From Desolation Row</p>
