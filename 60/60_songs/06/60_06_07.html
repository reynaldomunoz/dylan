    <p>Oh God said to Abraham, &ldquo;Kill me a son&rdquo;<br />
      Abe says, &ldquo;Man, you must be puttin&rsquo; me on&rdquo;<br />
      God say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Abe say, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br />
      God say, &ldquo;You can do what you want Abe, but<br />
      The next time you see me comin&rsquo; you better run&rdquo;<br />
      Well Abe says, &ldquo;Where do you want this killin&rsquo; done?&rdquo;<br />
      God says, &ldquo;Out on Highway 61&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose<br />
      Welfare Department they wouldn&rsquo;t give him no clothes<br />
      He asked poor Howard where can I go<br />
      Howard said there&rsquo;s only one place I know<br />
      Sam said tell me quick man I got to run<br />
      Ol&rsquo; Howard just pointed with his gun<br />
      And said that way down on Highway 61</p>
    <p>Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King<br />
      I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings<br />
      And a thousand telephones that don&rsquo;t ring<br />
      Do you know where I can get rid of these things<br />
      And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son<br />
      And he said yes I think it can be easily done<br />
      Just take everything down to Highway 61</p>
    <p>Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night<br />
      Told the first father that things weren&rsquo;t right<br />
      My complexion she said is much too white<br />
      He said come here and step into the light, he says hmm you&rsquo;re right<br />
      Let me tell the second mother this has been done<br />
      But the second mother was with the seventh son<br />
      And they were both out on Highway 61</p>
    <p>Now the rovin&rsquo; gambler he was very bored<br />
      He was tryin&rsquo; to create a next world war<br />
      He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor<br />
      He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before<br />
      But yes I think it can be very easily done<br />
      We&rsquo;ll just put some bleachers out in the sun<br />
      And have it on Highway 61</p>
