   <div id="song">
    <p>You walk into the room<br />
      With your pencil in your hand<br />
      You see somebody naked<br />
      And you say, &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo;<br />
      You try so hard<br />
      But you don&rsquo;t understand<br />
      Just what you&rsquo;ll say<br />
      When you get home</p>
    <p>Because something is happening here<br />
      But you don&rsquo;t know what it is<br />
      Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
    <p>You raise up your head<br />
      And you ask, &ldquo;Is this where it is?&rdquo;<br />
      And somebody points to you and says<br />
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his&rdquo;<br />
      And you say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s mine?&rdquo;<br />
      And somebody else says, &ldquo;Where what is?&rdquo;<br />
      And you say, &ldquo;Oh my God<br />
      Am I here all alone?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Because something is happening here<br />
      But you don&rsquo;t know what it is<br />
      Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
    <p>You hand in your ticket<br />
      And you go watch the geek<br />
      Who immediately walks up to you<br />
      When he hears you speak<br />
      And says, &ldquo;How does it feel<br />
      To be such a freak?&rdquo;<br />
      And you say, &ldquo;Impossible&rdquo;<br />
      As he hands you a bone</p>
    <p>Because something is happening here<br />
      But you don&rsquo;t know what it is<br />
      Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
    <p>You have many contacts<br />
      Among the lumberjacks<br />
      To get you facts<br />
      When someone attacks your imagination<br />
      But nobody has any respect<br />
      Anyway they already expect you<br />
      To just give a check<br />
      To tax-deductible charity organizations</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve been with the professors<br />
      And they&rsquo;ve all liked your looks<br />
      With great lawyers you have<br />
      Discussed lepers and crooks<br />
      You&rsquo;ve been through all of<br />
      F. Scott Fitzgerald&rsquo;s books<br />
      You&rsquo;re very well read<br />
      It&rsquo;s well known</p>
    <p>Because something is happening here<br />
      But you don&rsquo;t know what it is<br />
      Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
    <p>Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you<br />
      And then he kneels<br />
      He crosses himself<br />
      And then he clicks his high heels<br />
      And without further notice<br />
      He asks you how it feels<br />
      And he says, &ldquo;Here is your throat back<br />
      Thanks for the loan&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Because something is happening here<br />
      But you don&rsquo;t know what it is<br />
      Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
    <p>Now you see this one-eyed midget<br />
      Shouting the word &ldquo;NOW&rdquo;<br />
      And you say, &ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo;<br />
      And he says, &ldquo;How?&rdquo;<br />
      And you say, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;<br />
      And he screams back, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cow<br />
      Give me some milk<br />
      Or else go home&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Because something is happening here<br />
      But you don&rsquo;t know what it is<br />
      Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
    <p>Well, you walk into the room<br />
      Like a camel and then you frown<br />
      You put your eyes in your pocket<br />
      And your nose on the ground<br />
      There ought to be a law<br />
      Against you comin&rsquo; around<br />
      You should be made<br />
      To wear earphones</p>
    <p>Because something is happening here<br />
      But you don&rsquo;t know what it is<br />
      Do you, Mister Jones?</p>
