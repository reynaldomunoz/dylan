    <p>Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br />
      You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn&rsquo;t you?<br />
      People&rsquo;d call, say, &ldquo;Beware doll, you&rsquo;re bound to fall&rdquo;<br />
      You thought they were all kiddin&rsquo; you<br />
      You used to laugh about<br />
      Everybody that was hangin&rsquo; out<br />
      Now you don&rsquo;t talk so loud<br />
      Now you don&rsquo;t seem so proud<br />
      About having to be scrounging for your next meal</p>
    <p>How does it feel<br />
      How does it feel<br />
      To be without a home<br />
      Like a complete unknown<br />
      Like a rolling stone?</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely<br />
      But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br />
      And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street<br />
      And now you find out you&rsquo;re gonna have to get used to it<br />
      You said you&rsquo;d never compromise<br />
      With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br />
      He&rsquo;s not selling any alibis<br />
      As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br />
      And ask him do you want to make a deal?</p>
    <p>How does it feel<br />
      How does it feel<br />
      To be on your own<br />
      With no direction home<br />
      Like a complete unknown<br />
      Like a rolling stone?</p>
    <p>You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns<br />
      When they all come down and did tricks for you<br />
      You never understood that it ain&rsquo;t no good<br />
      You shouldn&rsquo;t let other people get your kicks for you<br />
      You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat<br />
      Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br />
      Ain&rsquo;t it hard when you discover that<br />
      He really wasn&rsquo;t where it&rsquo;s at<br />
      After he took from you everything he could steal</p>
    <p>How does it feel<br />
      How does it feel<br />
      To be on your own<br />
      With no direction home<br />
      Like a complete unknown<br />
      Like a rolling stone?</p>
    <p>Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people<br />
      They&rsquo;re drinkin&rsquo;, thinkin&rsquo; that they got it made<br />
      Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things<br />
      But you&rsquo;d better lift your diamond ring, you&rsquo;d better pawn it babe<br />
      You used to be so amused<br />
      At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br />
      Go to him now, he calls you, you can&rsquo;t refuse<br />
      When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br />
      You&rsquo;re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal</p>
    <p>How does it feel<br />
      How does it feel<br />
      To be on your own<br />
      With no direction home<br />
      Like a complete unknown<br />
      Like a rolling stone?   </p>
