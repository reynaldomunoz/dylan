    <p>I pounded on a farmhouse<br />
      Lookin&rsquo; for a place to stay<br />
      I was mighty,  mighty tired<br />
      I had come a long, long way<br />
      I said, &ldquo;Hey, hey, in there<br />
      Is  there anybody home?&rdquo;<br />
      I was standin&rsquo; on the steps<br />
      Feelin&rsquo; most alone<br />
      Well, out comes a farmer<br />
      He must have thought that I was nuts<br />
      He  immediately looked at me<br />
      And stuck a gun into my guts</p>
    <p>I fell down<br />
      To my bended knees<br />
      Saying, &ldquo;I dig farmers<br />
      Don&rsquo;t shoot  me, please!&rdquo;<br />
      He cocked his rifle<br />
      And began to shout<br />
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re that  travelin&rsquo; salesman<br />
      That I have heard about&rdquo;<br />
      I said, &ldquo;No! No! No!<br />
      I&rsquo;m a  doctor and it&rsquo;s true<br />
      I&rsquo;m a clean-cut kid<br />
      And I been to college, too&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Then in comes his daughter<br />
      Whose name was Rita<br />
      She looked like she  stepped out of<br />
      La Dolce Vita<br />
      I immediately tried to cool it<br />
      With her  dad<br />
      And told him what a<br />
      Nice, pretty farm he had<br />
      He said, &ldquo;What do  doctors<br />
      Know about farms, pray tell?&rdquo;<br />
      I said, &ldquo;I was born<br />
      At the bottom  of a wishing well&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, by the dirt &rsquo;neath my nails<br />
      I guess he knew I wouldn&rsquo;t lie<br />
      &ldquo;I  guess you&rsquo;re tired&rdquo;<br />
      He said, kinda sly<br />
      I said, &ldquo;Yes, ten thousand  miles<br />
      Today I drove&rdquo;<br />
      He said, &ldquo;I got a bed for you<br />
      Underneath the  stove<br />
      Just one condition<br />
      And you go to sleep right now<br />
      That you don&rsquo;t  touch my daughter<br />
      And in the morning, milk the cow&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I was sleepin&rsquo; like a rat<br />
      When I heard something jerkin&rsquo;<br />
      There stood  Rita<br />
      Lookin&rsquo; just like Tony Perkins<br />
      She said, &ldquo;Would you like to take a  shower?<br />
      I&rsquo;ll show you up to the door&rdquo;<br />
      I said, &ldquo;Oh, no! no!<br />
      I&rsquo;ve been  through this before&rdquo;<br />
      I knew I had to split<br />
      But I didn&rsquo;t know how<br />
      When  she said<br />
      &ldquo;Would you like to take that shower, now?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t leave<br />
      Unless the old man chased me out<br />
      &rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;d  already promised<br />
      That I&rsquo;d milk his cows<br />
      I had to say something<br />
      To  strike him very weird<br />
      So I yelled out<br />
      &ldquo;I like Fidel Castro and his  beard&rdquo;<br />
      Rita looked offended<br />
      But she got out of the way<br />
      As he came  charging down the stairs<br />
      Sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that I heard you say?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I said, &ldquo;I like Fidel Castro<br />
      I think you heard me right&rdquo;<br />
      And ducked as  he swung<br />
      At me with all his might<br />
      Rita mumbled something<br />
      &rsquo;Bout her  mother on the hill<br />
      As his fist hit the icebox<br />
      He said he&rsquo;s going to kill  me<br />
      If I don&rsquo;t get out the door<br />
      In two seconds flat<br />
      &ldquo;You unpatriotic<br />
      Rotten doctor Commie rat&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, he threw a Reader&rsquo;s Digest<br />
      At my head and I did run<br />
      I did a  somersault<br />
      As I seen him get his gun<br />
      And crashed through the window<br />
      At  a hundred miles an hour<br />
      And landed fully blast<br />
      In his garden flowers<br />
      Rita said, &ldquo;Come back!&rdquo;<br />
      As he started to load<br />
      The sun was comin&rsquo; up<br />
      And  I was runnin&rsquo; down the road</p>
    <p>Well, I don&rsquo;t figure I&rsquo;ll be back<br />
      There for a spell<br />
      Even though Rita  moved away<br />
      And got a job in a motel<br />
      He still waits for me<br />
      Constant, on  the sly<br />
      He wants to turn me in<br />
      To the F.B.I.<br />
      Me, I romp and stomp<br />
      Thankful as I romp<br />
      Without freedom of speech<br />
      I might be in the swamp</p>
