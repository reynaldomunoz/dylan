   <div id="song">
    <p>I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze<br />
      With the innocence of a lamb,  she was gentle like a fawn<br />
      I courted her proudly but now she is gone<br />
      Gone  as the season she&rsquo;s taken</p>
    <p>Through young summer&rsquo;s breeze, I stole her away<br />
      From her mother and  sister, though close did they stay<br />
      Each one of them suffering from the  failures of their day<br />
      With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us</p>
    <p>Of the two sisters, I loved the young<br />
      With sensitive instincts, she was  the creative one<br />
      The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone<br />
      By the  jealousy of others around her</p>
    <p>For her parasite sister, I had no respect<br />
      Bound by her boredom, her pride  to protect<br />
      Countless visions of the other she&rsquo;d reflect<br />
      As a crutch for  her scenes and her society</p>
    <p>Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused<br />
      The changes I was going  through can&rsquo;t even be used<br />
      For the lies that I told her in hopes not to  lose<br />
      The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime</p>
    <p>With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip<br />
      A magnificent  mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped<br />
      Noticing not that I&rsquo;d already  slipped<br />
      To a sin of love&rsquo;s false security</p>
    <p>From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace<br />
      Answers of emptiness, voice  vacancies<br />
      Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, &ldquo;Please<br />
      What&rsquo;s wrong and what&rsquo;s exactly the matter?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen<br />
      The timeless  explosion of fantasy&rsquo;s dream<br />
      At the peak of the night, the king and the  queen<br />
      Tumbled all down into pieces</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The tragic figure!&rdquo; her sister did shout<br />
      &ldquo;Leave her alone, God damn you,  get out!&rdquo;<br />
      And I in my armor, turning about<br />
      And nailing her to the ruins of  her pettiness</p>
    <p>Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound<br />
      Her sister and I in a  screaming battleground<br />
      And she in between, the victim of sound<br />
      Soon  shattered as a child &rsquo;neath her shadows</p>
    <p>All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight<br />
      I gagged twice, doubled,  tears blinding my sight<br />
      My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night<br />
      Leaving all of love&rsquo;s ashes behind me</p>
    <p>The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet<br />
      The words to say I&rsquo;m sorry,  I haven&rsquo;t found yet<br />
      I think of her often and hope whoever she&rsquo;s met<br />
      Will  be fully aware of how precious she is</p>
    <p>Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me<br />
      &ldquo;How good, how good does  it feel to be free?&rdquo;<br />
      And I answer them most mysteriously<br />
      &ldquo;Are birds free  from the chains of the skyway?&rdquo;</p>
