    <p>I&rsquo;m just average, common too<br />
      I&rsquo;m just like him, the same as you<br />
      I&rsquo;m everybody&rsquo;s brother and son<br />
      I ain&rsquo;t different from anyone<br />
      It ain&rsquo;t no use a-talking to me<br />
      It&rsquo;s just the same as talking to you</p>
    <p>I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day<br />
      I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay<br />
      I said &ldquo;Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come<br />
      26, 27, 28, 29, I&rsquo;m gonna make your face look just like mine<br />
      Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you&rsquo;d better run<br />
      99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won&rsquo;t even recognize you<br />
      14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ve been told<br />
      The streets in heaven are lined with gold<br />
      I ask you how things could get much worse<br />
      If the Russians happen to get up there first<br />
      Wowee! pretty scary!</p>
    <p>Now, I&rsquo;m liberal, but to a degree<br />
      I want ev&rsquo;rybody to be free<br />
      But if you think that I&rsquo;ll let Barry Goldwater<br />
      Move in next door and marry my daughter<br />
      You must think I&rsquo;m crazy!<br />
      I wouldn&rsquo;t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba</p>
    <p>Well, I set my monkey on the log<br />
      And ordered him to do the Dog<br />
      He wagged his tail and shook his head<br />
      And he went and did the Cat instead<br />
      He&rsquo;s a weird monkey, very funky</p>
    <p>I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on<br />
      Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun<br />
      I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist<br />
      And my wig-hat was falling in my face<br />
      But they wouldn&rsquo;t let me on the tennis court</p>
    <p>I got a woman, she&rsquo;s so mean<br />
      She sticks my boots in the washing machine<br />
      Sticks me with buckshot when I&rsquo;m nude<br />
      Puts bubblegum in my food<br />
      She&rsquo;s funny, wants my money, calls me &ldquo;honey&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Now I got a friend who spends his life<br />
      Stabbing my picture with a bowie knife<br />
      Dreams of strangling me with a scarf<br />
      When my name comes up he pretends to barf<br />
      I&rsquo;ve got a million friends!</p>
    <p>Now they asked me to read a poem<br />
      At the sorority sisters&rsquo; home<br />
      I got knocked down and my head was swimmin&rsquo;<br />
      I wound up with the Dean of Women<br />
      Yippee! I&rsquo;m a poet, and I know it<br />
      Hope I don&rsquo;t blow it</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange<br />
      So I look like a walking mountain range<br />
      And I&rsquo;m gonna ride into Omaha on a horse<br />
      Out to the country club and the golf course<br />
      Carry The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds</p>
    <p>Now you&rsquo;re probably wondering by now<br />
      Just what this song is all about<br />
      What&rsquo;s probably got you baffled more<br />
      Is what this thing here is for<br />
      It&rsquo;s nothing<br />
      It&rsquo;s something I learned over in England</p>
