    <p>I was riding on the Mayflower<br />
      When I thought I spied some land<br />
      I yelled for Captain Arab<br />
      I have yuh understand<br />
      Who came running to the deck<br />
      Said, &ldquo;Boys, forget the whale<br />
      Look on over yonder<br />
      Cut the engines<br />
      Change the sail<br />
      Haul on the bowline&rdquo;<br />
      We sang that melody<br />
      Like all tough sailors do<br />
      When they are far away at sea</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll call it America&rdquo;<br />
      I said as we hit land<br />
      I took a deep breath<br />
      I fell down, I could not stand<br />
      Captain Arab he started<br />
      Writing up some deeds<br />
      He said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set up a fort<br />
      And start buying the place with beads&rdquo;<br />
      Just then this cop comes down the street<br />
      Crazy as a loon<br />
      He throw us all in jail<br />
      For carryin&rsquo; harpoons</p>
    <p>Ah me I busted out<br />
      Don&rsquo;t even ask me how<br />
      I went to get some help<br />
      I walked by a Guernsey cow<br />
      Who directed me down<br />
      To the Bowery slums<br />
      Where people carried signs around<br />
      Saying, &ldquo;Ban the bums&rdquo;<br />
      I jumped right into line<br />
      Sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;I hope that I&rsquo;m not late&rdquo;<br />
      When I realized I hadn&rsquo;t eaten<br />
      For five days straight</p>
    <p>I went into a restaurant<br />
      Lookin&rsquo; for the cook<br />
      I told them I was the editor<br />
      Of a famous etiquette book<br />
      The waitress he was handsome<br />
      He wore a powder blue cape<br />
      I ordered some suzette, I said<br />
      &ldquo;Could you please make that crepe&rdquo;<br />
      Just then the whole kitchen exploded<br />
      From boilin&rsquo; fat<br />
      Food was flying everywhere<br />
      And I left without my hat</p>
    <p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t mean to be nosy<br />
      But I went into a bank<br />
      To get some bail for Arab<br />
      And all the boys back in the tank<br />
      They asked me for some collateral<br />
      And I pulled down my pants<br />
      They threw me in the alley<br />
      When up comes this girl from France<br />
      Who invited me to her house<br />
      I went, but she had a friend<br />
      Who knocked me out<br />
      And robbed my boots<br />
      And I was on the street again</p>
    <p>Well, I rapped upon a house<br />
      With the U.S. flag upon display<br />
      I said, &ldquo;Could you help me out<br />
      I got some friends down the way&rdquo;<br />
      The man says, &ldquo;Get out of here<br />
      I&rsquo;ll tear you limb from limb&rdquo;<br />
      I said, &ldquo;You know they refused Jesus, too&rdquo;<br />
      He said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Him<br />
      Get out of here before I break your bones<br />
      I ain&rsquo;t your pop&rdquo;<br />
      I decided to have him arrested<br />
      And I went looking for a cop</p>
    <p>I ran right outside<br />
      And I hopped inside a cab<br />
      I went out the other door<br />
      This Englishman said, &ldquo;Fab&rdquo;<br />
      As he saw me leap a hot dog stand<br />
      And a chariot that stood<br />
      Parked across from a building<br />
      Advertising brotherhood<br />
      I ran right through the front door<br />
      Like a hobo sailor does<br />
      But it was just a funeral parlor<br />
      And the man asked me who I was</p>
    <p>I repeated that my friends<br />
      Were all in jail, with a sigh<br />
      He gave me his card<br />
      He said, &ldquo;Call me if they die&rdquo;<br />
      I shook his hand and said goodbye<br />
      Ran out to the street<br />
      When a bowling ball came down the road<br />
      And knocked me off my feet<br />
      A pay phone was ringing<br />
      It just about blew my mind<br />
      When I picked it up and said hello<br />
      This foot came through the line</p>
    <p>Well, by this time I was fed up<br />
      At tryin&rsquo; to make a stab<br />
      At bringin&rsquo; back any help<br />
      For my friends and Captain Arab<br />
      I decided to flip a coin<br />
      Like either heads or tails<br />
      Would let me know if I should go<br />
      Back to ship or back to jail<br />
      So I hocked my sailor suit<br />
      And I got a coin to flip<br />
      It came up tails<br />
      It rhymed with sails<br />
      So I made it back to the ship</p>
    <p>Well, I got back and took<br />
      The parkin&rsquo; ticket off the mast<br />
      I was ripping it to shreds<br />
      When this coastguard boat went past<br />
      They asked me my name<br />
      And I said, &ldquo;Captain Kidd&rdquo;<br />
      They believed me but<br />
      They wanted to know<br />
      What exactly that I did<br />
      I said for the Pope of Eruke<br />
      I was employed<br />
      They let me go right away<br />
      They were very paranoid</p>
    <p>Well, the last I heard of Arab<br />
      He was stuck on a whale<br />
      That was married to the deputy<br />
      Sheriff of the jail<br />
      But the funniest thing was<br />
      When I was leavin&rsquo; the bay<br />
      I saw three ships a-sailin&rsquo;<br />
      They were all heading my way<br />
      I asked the captain what his name was<br />
      And how come he didn&rsquo;t drive a truck<br />
      He said his name was Columbus<br />
      I just said, &ldquo;Good luck&rdquo;</p>
