   <div id="song">
    <p>Of war and peace the truth just twists<br />
      Its curfew gull just glides<br />
      Upon four-legged forest clouds<br />
      The cowboy angel rides<br />
      With his candle lit into the sun<br />
      Though its glow is waxed in black<br />
      All except when &rsquo;neath the trees of Eden</p>
    <p>The lamppost stands with folded arms<br />
      Its iron claws attached<br />
      To curbs &rsquo;neath holes where babies wail<br />
      Though it shadows metal badge<br />
      All and all can only fall<br />
      With a crashing but meaningless blow<br />
      No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden</p>
    <p>The savage soldier sticks his head in sand<br />
      And then complains<br />
      Unto the shoeless hunter who&rsquo;s gone deaf<br />
      But still remains<br />
      Upon the beach where hound dogs bay<br />
      At ships with tattooed sails<br />
      Heading for the Gates of Eden</p>
    <p>With a time-rusted compass blade<br />
      Aladdin and his lamp<br />
      Sits with Utopian hermit monks<br />
      Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf<br />
      And on their promises of paradise<br />
      You will not hear a laugh<br />
      All except inside the Gates of Eden</p>
    <p>Relationships of ownership<br />
      They whisper in the wings<br />
      To those condemned to act accordingly<br />
      And wait for succeeding kings<br />
      And I try to harmonize with songs<br />
      The lonesome sparrow sings<br />
      There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden</p>
    <p>The motorcycle black madonna<br />
      Two-wheeled gypsy queen<br />
      And her silver-studded phantom cause<br />
      The gray flannel dwarf to scream<br />
      As he weeps to wicked birds of prey<br />
      Who pick up on his bread crumb sins<br />
      And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden</p>
    <p>The kingdoms of Experience<br />
      In the precious wind they rot<br />
      While paupers change possessions<br />
      Each one wishing for what the other has got<br />
      And the princess and the prince<br />
      Discuss what&rsquo;s real and what is not<br />
      It doesn&rsquo;t matter inside the Gates of Eden</p>
    <p>The foreign sun, it squints upon<br />
      A bed that is never mine<br />
      As friends and other strangers<br />
      From their fates try to resign<br />
      Leaving men wholly, totally free<br />
      To do anything they wish to do but die<br />
      And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden</p>
    <p>At dawn my lover comes to me<br />
      And tells me of her dreams<br />
      With no attempts to shovel the glimpse<br />
      Into the ditch of what each one means<br />
      At times I think there are no words<br />
      But these to tell what&rsquo;s true<br />
      And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden</p>
