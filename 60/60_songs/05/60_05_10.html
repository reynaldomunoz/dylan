   <div id="song">
    <p>Darkness at the break of noon<br />
      Shadows even the silver spoon<br />
      The handmade blade, the child&rsquo;s balloon<br />
      Eclipses both the sun and moon<br />
      To understand you know too soon<br />
      There is no sense in trying</p>
    <p>Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn<br />
      Suicide remarks are torn<br />
      From the fool&rsquo;s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn<br />
      Plays wasted words, proves to warn<br />
      That he not busy being born is busy dying</p>
    <p>Temptation&rsquo;s page flies out the door<br />
      You follow, find yourself at war<br />
      Watch waterfalls of pity roar<br />
      You feel to moan but unlike before<br />
      You discover that you&rsquo;d just be one more<br />
      Person crying</p>
    <p>So don&rsquo;t fear if you hear<br />
      A foreign sound to your ear<br />
      It&rsquo;s alright, Ma, I&rsquo;m only sighing</p>
    <p>As some warn victory, some downfall<br />
      Private reasons great or small<br />
      Can be seen in the eyes of those that call<br />
      To make all that should be killed to crawl<br />
      While others say don&rsquo;t hate nothing at all<br />
      Except hatred</p>
    <p>Disillusioned words like bullets bark<br />
      As human gods aim for their mark<br />
      Make everything from toy guns that spark<br />
      To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark<br />
      It&rsquo;s easy to see without looking too far<br />
      That not much is really sacred</p>
    <p>While preachers preach of evil fates<br />
      Teachers teach that knowledge waits<br />
      Can lead to hundred-dollar plates<br />
      Goodness hides behind its gates<br />
      But even the president of the United States<br />
      Sometimes must have to stand naked</p>
    <p>An&rsquo; though the rules of the road have been lodged<br />
      It&rsquo;s only people&rsquo;s games that you got to dodge<br />
      And it&rsquo;s alright, Ma, I can make it</p>
    <p>Advertising signs they con<br />
      You into thinking you&rsquo;re the one<br />
      That can do what&rsquo;s never been done<br />
      That can win what&rsquo;s never been won<br />
      Meantime life outside goes on<br />
      All around you</p>
    <p>You lose yourself, you reappear<br />
      You suddenly find you got nothing to fear<br />
      Alone you stand with nobody near<br />
      When a trembling distant voice, unclear<br />
      Startles your sleeping ears to hear<br />
      That somebody thinks they really found you</p>
    <p>A question in your nerves is lit<br />
      Yet you know there is no answer fit<br />
      To satisfy, insure you not to quit<br />
      To keep it in your mind and not forget<br />
      That it is not he or she or them or it<br />
      That you belong to</p>
    <p>Although the masters make the rules<br />
      For the wise men and the fools<br />
      I got nothing, Ma, to live up to</p>
    <p>For them that must obey authority<br />
      That they do not respect in any degree<br />
      Who despise their jobs, their destinies<br />
      Speak jealously of them that are free<br />
      Cultivate their flowers to be<br />
      Nothing more than something they invest in</p>
    <p>While some on principles baptized<br />
      To strict party platform ties<br />
      Social clubs in drag disguise<br />
      Outsiders they can freely criticize<br />
      Tell nothing except who to idolize<br />
      And then say God bless him</p>
    <p>While one who sings with his tongue on fire<br />
      Gargles in the rat race choir<br />
      Bent out of shape from society&rsquo;s pliers<br />
      Cares not to come up any higher<br />
      But rather get you down in the hole<br />
      That he&rsquo;s in</p>
    <p>But I mean no harm nor put fault<br />
      On anyone that lives in a vault<br />
      But it&rsquo;s alright, Ma, if I can&rsquo;t please him</p>
    <p>Old lady judges watch people in pairs<br />
      Limited in sex, they dare<br />
      To push fake morals, insult and stare<br />
      While money doesn&rsquo;t talk, it swears<br />
      Obscenity, who really cares<br />
      Propaganda, all is phony</p>
    <p>While them that defend what they cannot see<br />
      With a killer&rsquo;s pride, security<br />
      It blows the minds most bitterly<br />
      For them that think death&rsquo;s honesty<br />
      Won&rsquo;t fall upon them naturally<br />
      Life sometimes must get lonely</p>
    <p>My eyes collide head-on with stuffed<br />
      Graveyards, false gods, I scuff<br />
      At pettiness which plays so rough<br />
      Walk upside-down inside handcuffs<br />
      Kick my legs to crash it off<br />
      Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?</p>
    <p>And if my thought-dreams could be seen<br />
      They&rsquo;d probably put my head in a guillotine<br />
      But it&rsquo;s alright, Ma, it&rsquo;s life, and life only</p>
