    The Ballad Of Frankie Lee And Judas Priest</div>
  <div data-role="content" data-theme="c">
   <div id="song">
    <p>Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest<br />
      They were the best of friends<br />
      So when Frankie Lee needed money one day<br />
      Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens<br />
      And placed them on a footstool<br />
      Just above the plotted plain<br />
      Sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Take your pick, Frankie Boy<br />
      My loss will be your gain&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down<br />
      And put his fingers to his chin<br />
      But with the cold eyes of Judas on him<br />
      His head began to spin<br />
      &ldquo;Would ya please not stare at me like that,&rdquo; he said<br />
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just my foolish pride<br />
      But sometimes a man must be alone<br />
      And this is no place to hide&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, Judas, he just winked and said<br />
      &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll leave you here<br />
      But you&rsquo;d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want<br />
      Before they all disappear&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna start my pickin&rsquo; right now<br />
      Just tell me where you&rsquo;ll be&rdquo;<br />
      Judas pointed down the road<br />
      And said, &ldquo;Eternity!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Eternity?&rdquo; said Frankie Lee<br />
      With a voice as cold as ice<br />
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Judas Priest, &ldquo;Eternity<br />
      Though you might call it &lsquo;Paradise&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it anything&rdquo;<br />
      Said Frankie Lee with a smile<br />
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Judas Priest<br />
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you after a while&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down<br />
      Feelin&rsquo; low and mean<br />
      When just then a passing stranger<br />
      Burst upon the scene<br />
      Saying, &ldquo;Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler<br />
      Whose father is deceased?<br />
      Well, if you are, there&rsquo;s a fellow callin&rsquo; you down the road<br />
      And they say his name is Priest&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he is my friend&rdquo;<br />
      Said Frankie Lee in fright<br />
      &ldquo;I do recall him very well<br />
      In fact, he just left my sight&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; said the stranger<br />
      As quiet as a mouse<br />
      &ldquo;Well, my message is, he&rsquo;s down the road<br />
      Stranded in a house&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked<br />
      He dropped ev&rsquo;rything and ran<br />
      Until he came up to the spot<br />
      Where Judas Priest did stand<br />
      &ldquo;What kind of house is this,&rdquo; he said<br />
      &ldquo;Where I have come to roam?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a house,&rdquo; said Judas Priest<br />
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a house . . . it&rsquo;s a home&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled<br />
      He soon lost all control<br />
      Over ev&rsquo;rything which he had made<br />
      While the mission bells did toll<br />
      He just stood there staring<br />
      At that big house as bright as any sun<br />
      With four and twenty windows<br />
      And a woman&rsquo;s face in ev&rsquo;ry one</p>
    <p>Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee<br />
      With a soulful, bounding leap<br />
      And, foaming at the mouth<br />
      He began to make his midnight creep<br />
      For sixteen nights and days he raved<br />
      But on the seventeenth he burst<br />
      Into the arms of Judas Priest<br />
      Which is where he died of thirst</p>
    <p>No one tried to say a thing<br />
      When they took him out in jest<br />
      Except, of course, the little neighbor boy<br />
      Who carried him to rest<br />
      And he just walked along, alone<br />
      With his guilt so well concealed<br />
      And muttered underneath his breath<br />
      &ldquo;Nothing is revealed&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, the moral of the story<br />
      The moral of this song<br />
      Is simply that one should never be<br />
      Where one does not belong<br />
      So when you see your neighbor carryin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;<br />
      Help him with his load<br />
      And don&rsquo;t go mistaking Paradise<br />
      For that home across the road</p>
