    <p>Early one mornin&rsquo; the sun was shinin&rsquo;<br />
      I was layin&rsquo; in bed<br />
      Wond&rsquo;rin&rsquo; if she&rsquo;d changed at all<br />
      If her hair was still red<br />
      Her folks they said our lives together<br />
      Sure was gonna be rough<br />
      They never did like Mama&rsquo;s homemade dress<br />
      Papa&rsquo;s bankbook wasn&rsquo;t big enough<br />
      And I was standin&rsquo; on the side of the road<br />
      Rain fallin&rsquo; on my shoes<br />
      Heading out for the East Coast<br />
      Lord knows I&rsquo;ve paid some dues gettin&rsquo; through<br />
      Tangled up in blue</p>
    <p>She was married when we first met<br />
      Soon to be divorced<br />
      I helped her out of a jam, I guess<br />
      But I used a little too much force<br />
      We drove that car as far as we could<br />
      Abandoned it out West<br />
      Split up on a dark sad night<br />
      Both agreeing it was best<br />
      She turned around to look at me<br />
      As I was walkin&rsquo; away<br />
      I heard her say over my shoulder<br />
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again someday on the avenue&rdquo;<br />
      Tangled up in blue</p>
    <p>I had a job in the great north woods<br />
      Working as a cook for a spell<br />
      But I never did like it all that much<br />
      And one day the ax just fell<br />
      So I drifted down to New Orleans<br />
      Where I happened to be employed<br />
      Workin&rsquo; for a while on a fishin&rsquo; boat<br />
      Right outside of Delacroix<br />
      But all the while I was alone<br />
      The past was close behind<br />
      I seen a lot of women<br />
      But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew<br />
      Tangled up in blue</p>
    <p>She was workin&rsquo; in a topless place<br />
      And I stopped in for a beer<br />
      I just kept lookin&rsquo; at the side of her face<br />
      In the spotlight so clear<br />
      And later on as the crowd thinned out<br />
      I&rsquo;s just about to do the same<br />
      She was standing there in back of my chair<br />
      Said to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know your name?&rdquo;<br />
      I muttered somethin&rsquo; underneath my breath<br />
      She studied the lines on my face<br />
      I must admit I felt a little uneasy<br />
      When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe<br />
      Tangled up in blue</p>
    <p>She lit a burner on the stove<br />
      And offered me a pipe<br />
      &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never say hello,&rdquo; she said<br />
      &ldquo;You look like the silent type&rdquo;<br />
      Then she opened up a book of poems<br />
      And handed it to me<br />
      Written by an Italian poet<br />
      From the thirteenth century<br />
      And every one of them words rang true<br />
      And glowed like burnin&rsquo; coal<br />
      Pourin&rsquo; off of every page<br />
      Like it was written in my soul from me to you<br />
      Tangled up in blue</p>
    <p>I lived with them on Montague Street<br />
      In a basement down the stairs<br />
      There was music in the cafés at night<br />
      And revolution in the air<br />
      Then he started into dealing with slaves<br />
      And something inside of him died<br />
      She had to sell everything she owned<br />
      And froze up inside<br />
      And when finally the bottom fell out<br />
      I became withdrawn<br />
      The only thing I knew how to do<br />
      Was to keep on keepin&rsquo; on like a bird that flew<br />
      Tangled up in blue</p>
    <p>So now I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; back again<br />
      I got to get to her somehow<br />
      All the people we used to know<br />
      They&rsquo;re an illusion to me now<br />
      Some are mathematicians<br />
      Some are carpenters&rsquo; wives<br />
      Don&rsquo;t know how it all got started<br />
      I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; with their lives<br />
      But me, I&rsquo;m still on the road<br />
      Headin&rsquo; for another joint<br />
      We always did feel the same<br />
      We just saw it from a different point of view<br />
      Tangled up in blue</p>
