    <p>The festival was over, the boys were all plannin&rsquo; for a fall<br />
      The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin&rsquo; in the wall<br />
      The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin&rsquo; wheel shut down<br />
      Anyone with any sense had already left town<br />
      He was standin&rsquo; in the doorway lookin&rsquo; like the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>He moved across the mirrored room, &ldquo;Set it up for everyone,&rdquo; he said<br />
      Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin&rsquo; before he turned their heads<br />
      Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin<br />
      &ldquo;Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?&rdquo;<br />
      Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>Backstage the girls were playin&rsquo; five-card stud by the stairs<br />
      Lily had two queens, she was hopin&rsquo; for a third to match her pair<br />
      Outside the streets were fillin&rsquo; up, the window was open wide<br />
      A gentle breeze was blowin&rsquo;, you could feel it from inside<br />
      Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>Big Jim was no one&rsquo;s fool, he owned the town&rsquo;s only diamond mine<br />
      He made his usual entrance lookin&rsquo; so dandy and so fine<br />
      With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place<br />
      He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste<br />
      But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town<br />
      She slipped in through the side door lookin&rsquo; like a queen without a crown<br />
      She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear<br />
      &ldquo;Sorry, darlin&rsquo;, that I&rsquo;m late,&rdquo; but he didn&rsquo;t seem to hear<br />
      He was starin&rsquo; into space over at the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve seen that face before,&rdquo; Big Jim was thinkin&rsquo; to himself<br />
      &ldquo;Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody&rsquo;s shelf&rdquo;<br />
      But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim<br />
      And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him<br />
      Starin&rsquo; at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child<br />
      She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled<br />
      She&rsquo;d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs<br />
      With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere<br />
      But she&rsquo;d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>The hangin&rsquo; judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined<br />
      The drillin&rsquo; in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind<br />
      It was known all around that Lily had Jim&rsquo;s ring<br />
      And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king<br />
      No, nothin&rsquo; ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>Rosemary started drinkin&rsquo; hard and seein&rsquo; her reflection in the knife<br />
      She was tired of the attention, tired of playin&rsquo; the role of Big Jim&rsquo;s wife<br />
      She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide<br />
      Was lookin&rsquo; to do just one good deed before she died<br />
      She was gazin&rsquo; to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away<br />
      &ldquo;Has your luck run out?&rdquo; she laughed at him, &ldquo;Well, I guess you must<br />
      have known it would someday<br />
      Be careful not to touch the wall, there&rsquo;s a brand-new coat of paint<br />
      I&rsquo;m glad to see you&rsquo;re still alive, you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; like a saint&rdquo;<br />
      Down the hallway footsteps were comin&rsquo; for the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair<br />
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something funny going on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can just feel it in the air&rdquo;<br />
      He went to get the hangin&rsquo; judge, but the hangin&rsquo; judge was drunk<br />
      As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk<br />
      There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>Lily&rsquo;s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch<br />
      She forgot all about the man she couldn&rsquo;t stand who hounded her so much<br />
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you so,&rdquo; she said to him, and he felt she was sincere<br />
      But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear<br />
      Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick<br />
      The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked<br />
      And Big Jim was standin&rsquo; there, ya couldn&rsquo;t say surprised<br />
      Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes<br />
      She was with Big Jim but she was leanin&rsquo; to the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall<br />
      And cleaned out the bank safe, it&rsquo;s said that they got off with quite a haul<br />
      In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground<br />
      For one more member who had business back in town<br />
      But they couldn&rsquo;t go no further without the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>The next day was hangin&rsquo; day, the sky was overcast and black<br />
      Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back<br />
      And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn&rsquo;t even blink<br />
      The hangin&rsquo; judge was sober, he hadn&rsquo;t had a drink<br />
      The only person on the scene missin&rsquo; was the Jack of Hearts</p>
    <p>The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, &ldquo;Closed for repair&rdquo;<br />
      Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair<br />
      She was thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout her father, who she very rarely saw<br />
      Thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout Rosemary and thinkin&rsquo; about the law<br />
      But most of all she was thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout the Jack of Hearts</p>
