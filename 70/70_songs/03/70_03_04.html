    <p>Someone&rsquo;s got it in for me, they&rsquo;re planting stories in the press<br />
      Whoever it is I wish they&rsquo;d cut it out but when they will I can only guess<br />
      They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy<br />
      She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me<br />
      I can&rsquo;t help it if I&rsquo;m lucky</p>
    <p>People see me all the time and they just can&rsquo;t remember how to act<br />
      Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts<br />
      Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at<br />
      I couldn&rsquo;t believe after all these years, you didn&rsquo;t know me better than that<br />
      Sweet lady</p>
    <p>Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth<br />
      Blowing down the backroads headin&rsquo; south<br />
      Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth<br />
      You&rsquo;re an idiot, babe<br />
      It&rsquo;s a wonder that you still know how to breathe</p>
    <p>I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike<br />
      I haven&rsquo;t known peace and quiet for so long I can&rsquo;t remember what it&rsquo;s like<br />
      There&rsquo;s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin&rsquo; out of a boxcar door<br />
      You didn&rsquo;t know it, you didn&rsquo;t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars<br />
      After losin&rsquo; every battle</p>
    <p>I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout the way things sometimes are<br />
      Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin&rsquo; me see stars<br />
      You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies<br />
      One day you&rsquo;ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin&rsquo; around your eyes<br />
      Blood on your saddle</p>
    <p>Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb<br />
      Blowing through the curtains in your room<br />
      Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth<br />
      You&rsquo;re an idiot, babe<br />
      It&rsquo;s a wonder that you still know how to breathe</p>
    <p>It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart<br />
      You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn&rsquo;t enough to change my heart<br />
      Now everything&rsquo;s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped<br />
      What&rsquo;s good is bad, what&rsquo;s bad is good, you&rsquo;ll find out when you reach the top<br />
      You&rsquo;re on the bottom</p>
    <p>I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind<br />
      I can&rsquo;t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes
      don&rsquo;t look into mine<br />
      The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
      building burned<br />
      I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
      springtime turned<br />
      Slowly into Autumn</p>
    <p>Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull<br />
      From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol<br />
      Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth<br />
      You&rsquo;re an idiot, babe<br />
      It&rsquo;s a wonder that you still know how to breathe</p>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t feel you anymore, I can&rsquo;t even touch the books you&rsquo;ve read<br />
      Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin&rsquo; I was somebody else instead<br />
      Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy<br />
      I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory<br />
      And all your ragin&rsquo; glory</p>
    <p>I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I&rsquo;m finally free<br />
      I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me<br />
      You&rsquo;ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above<br />
      And I&rsquo;ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love<br />
      And it makes me feel so sorry</p>
    <p>Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats<br />
      Blowing through the letters that we wrote<br />
      Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves<br />
      We&rsquo;re idiots, babe<br />
      It&rsquo;s a wonder we can even feed ourselves</p>
