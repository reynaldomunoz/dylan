    <p>They sat together in the park<br />
      As the evening sky grew dark<br />
      She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones<br />
      &rsquo;Twas then he felt alone and wished that he&rsquo;d gone straight<br />
      And watched out for a simple twist of fate</p>
    <p>They walked along by the old canal<br />
      A little confused, I remember well<br />
      And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin&rsquo; bright<br />
      He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train<br />
      Moving with a simple twist of fate</p>
    <p>A saxophone someplace far off played<br />
      As she was walkin&rsquo; by the arcade<br />
      As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin&rsquo; up,<br />
      She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate<br />
      And forgot about a simple twist of fate</p>
    <p>He woke up, the room was bare<br />
      He didn&rsquo;t see her anywhere<br />
      He told himself he didn&rsquo;t care, pushed the window open wide<br />
      Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate<br />
      Brought on by a simple twist of fate</p>
    <p>He hears the ticking of the clocks<br />
      And walks along with a parrot that talks<br />
      Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in<br />
      Maybe she&rsquo;ll pick him out again, how long must he wait<br />
      Once more for a simple twist of fate</p>
    <p>People tell me it&rsquo;s a sin<br />
      To know and feel too much within<br />
      I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring<br />
      She was born in spring, but I was born too late<br />
      Blame it on a simple twist of fate</p>
