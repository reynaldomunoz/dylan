    <p>&rsquo;Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood<br />
      When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud<br />
      I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured<br />
      I&rsquo;ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word<br />
      In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved<br />
      Everything up to that point had been left unresolved<br />
      Try imagining a place where it&rsquo;s always safe and warm<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail<br />
      Poisoned in the bushes an&rsquo; blown out on the trail<br />
      Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Suddenly I turned around and she was standin&rsquo; there<br />
      With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair<br />
      She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Now there&rsquo;s a wall between us, somethin&rsquo; there&rsquo;s been lost<br />
      I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed<br />
      Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount<br />
      But nothing really matters much, it&rsquo;s doom alone that counts<br />
      And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve heard newborn babies wailin&rsquo; like a mournin&rsquo; dove<br />
      And old men with broken teeth stranded without love<br />
      Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes<br />
      I bargained for salvation an&rsquo; they gave me a lethal dose<br />
      I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo; in a foreign country but I&rsquo;m bound to cross the line<br />
      Beauty walks a razor&rsquo;s edge, someday I&rsquo;ll make it mine<br />
      If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born<br />
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you shelter from the storm&rdquo;</p>
