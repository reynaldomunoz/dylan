    <p>Up on the white veranda<br />
      She wears a necktie and a Panama hat<br />
      Her passport shows a face<br />
      From another time and place<br />
      She looks nothin&rsquo; like that<br />
      And all the remnants of her recent past<br />
      Are scattered in the wild wind<br />
      She walks across the marble floor<br />
      Where a voice from the gambling room is callin&rsquo; her to come on in<br />
      She smiles, walks the other way<br />
      As the last ship sails and the moon fades away<br />
      From Black Diamond Bay</p>
    <p>As the mornin&rsquo; light breaks open, the Greek comes down<br />
      And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write<br />
      &ldquo;Pardon, monsieur,&rdquo; the desk clerk says<br />
      Carefully removes his fez<br />
      &ldquo;Am I hearin&rsquo; you right?&rdquo;<br />
      And as the yellow fog is liftin&rsquo;<br />
      The Greek is quickly headin&rsquo; for the second floor<br />
      She passes him on the spiral staircase<br />
      Thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s the Soviet Ambassador<br />
      She starts to speak, but he walks away<br />
      As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway<br />
      On Black Diamond Bay</p>
    <p>A soldier sits beneath the fan<br />
      Doin&rsquo; business with a tiny man who sells him a ring<br />
      Lightning strikes, the lights blow out<br />
      The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout<br />
      &ldquo;Can you see anything?&rdquo;<br />
      Then the Greek appears on the second floor<br />
      In his bare feet with a rope around his neck<br />
      While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle<br />
      Says, &ldquo;Open up another deck&rdquo;<br />
      But the dealer says, &ldquo;Attendez-vous, s&rsquo;il vous plait&rdquo;<br />
      As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away<br />
      From Black Diamond Bay</p>
    <p>The desk clerk heard the woman laugh<br />
      As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough<br />
      He tried to grab the woman&rsquo;s hand<br />
      Said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a ring, it cost a grand&rdquo;<br />
      She said, &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t enough&rdquo;<br />
      Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags<br />
      While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb<br />
      She passed the door that the Greek had locked<br />
      Where a handwritten sign read, &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo;<br />
      She knocked upon it anyway<br />
      As the sun went down and the music did play<br />
      On Black Diamond Bay</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to talk to someone quick!&rdquo;<br />
      But the Greek said, &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; and he kicked the chair to the floor<br />
      He hung there from the chandelier<br />
      She cried, &ldquo;Help, there&rsquo;s danger near<br />
      Please open up the door!&rdquo;<br />
      Then the volcano erupted<br />
      And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above<br />
      The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner<br />
      Thinking of forbidden love<br />
      But the desk clerk said, &ldquo;It happens every day&rdquo;<br />
      As the stars fell down and the fields burned away<br />
      On Black Diamond Bay</p>
    <p>As the island slowly sank<br />
      The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room<br />
      The dealer said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now<br />
      You can take your money, but I don&rsquo;t know how<br />
      You&rsquo;ll spend it in the tomb&rdquo;<br />
      The tiny man bit the soldier&rsquo;s ear<br />
      As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew<br />
      While she&rsquo;s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her<br />
      &ldquo;My darling, je vous aime beaucoup&rdquo;<br />
      She sheds a tear and then begins to pray<br />
      As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away<br />
      From Black Diamond Bay</p>
    <p>I was sittin&rsquo; home alone one night in L.A.<br />
      Watchin&rsquo; old Cronkite on the seven o&rsquo;clock news<br />
      It seems there was an earthquake that<br />
      Left nothin&rsquo; but a Panama hat<br />
      And a pair of old Greek shoes<br />
      Didn&rsquo;t seem like much was happenin&rsquo;,<br />
      So I turned it off and went to grab another beer<br />
      Seems like every time you turn around<br />
      There&rsquo;s another hard-luck story that you&rsquo;re gonna hear<br />
      And there&rsquo;s really nothin&rsquo; anyone can say<br />
      And I never did plan to go anyway<br />
      To Black Diamond Bay</p>
