    <p>Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when<br />
      Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion<br />
      Always on the outside of whatever side there was<br />
      When they asked him why it had to be that way, &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered,<br />
      &ldquo;just because&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last<br />
      They called Joe &ldquo;Crazy,&rdquo; the baby they called &ldquo;Kid Blast&rdquo;<br />
      Some say they lived off gambling and runnin&rsquo; numbers too<br />
      It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue</p>
    <p>Joey, Joey<br />
      King of the streets, child of clay<br />
      Joey, Joey<br />
      What made them want to come and blow you away?</p>
    <p>There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that<br />
      No one ever knew for sure where they were really at<br />
      When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof<br />
      He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin&rsquo; he was bulletproof</p>
    <p>The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets<br />
      Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats<br />
      Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners<br />
      They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs</p>
    <p>The hostages were tremblin&rsquo; when they heard a man exclaim<br />
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame&rdquo;<br />
      But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not those kind of men<br />
      It&rsquo;s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Joey, Joey<br />
      King of the streets, child of clay<br />
      Joey, Joey<br />
      What made them want to come and blow you away?</p>
    <p>The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith<br />
      They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with<br />
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; said the judge to Joey when they met<br />
      &ldquo;Five to ten,&rdquo; said Joey. The judge says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what you get&rdquo;</p>
    <p>He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich<br />
      They threw him in the hole one time for tryin&rsquo; to stop a strike<br />
      His closest friends were black men &rsquo;cause they seemed to understand<br />
      What it&rsquo;s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand</p>
    <p>When they let him out in &rsquo;71 he&rsquo;d lost a little weight<br />
      But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great<br />
      He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind<br />
      To the boss he said, &ldquo;I have returned and now I want what&rsquo;s mine&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Joey, Joey<br />
      King of the streets, child of clay<br />
      Joey, Joey<br />
      Why did they have to come and blow you away?</p>
    <p>It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun<br />
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m around too many children,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;they should never know of one&rdquo;<br />
      Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe<br />
      Emptied out the register, said, &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em it was Crazy Joe&rdquo;</p>
    <p>One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York<br />
      He could see it comin&rsquo; through the door as he lifted up his fork<br />
      He pushed the table over to protect his family<br />
      Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy</p>
    <p>Joey, Joey<br />
      King of the streets, child of clay<br />
      Joey, Joey<br />
      What made them want to come and blow you away?</p>
    <p>Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep<br />
      I heard his best friend Frankie say, &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t dead, he&rsquo;s just asleep&rdquo;<br />
      Then I saw the old man&rsquo;s limousine head back towards the grave<br />
      I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save</p>
    <p>The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned<br />
      They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born<br />
      And someday if God&rsquo;s in heaven overlookin&rsquo; His preserve<br />
      I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve</p>
    <p>Joey, Joey<br />
      King of the streets, child of clay<br />
      Joey, Joey<br />
      What made them want to come and blow you away?</p>
