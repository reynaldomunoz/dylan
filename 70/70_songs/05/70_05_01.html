    <p>Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night<br />
      Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall<br />
      She sees the bartender in a pool of blood<br />
      Cries out, &ldquo;My God, they killed them all!&rdquo;<br />
      Here comes the story of the Hurricane<br />
      The man the authorities came to blame<br />
      For somethin&rsquo; that he never done<br />
      Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br />
      The champion of the world</p>
    <p>Three bodies lyin&rsquo; there does Patty see<br />
      And another man named Bello, movin&rsquo; around mysteriously<br />
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he says, and he throws up his hands<br />
      &ldquo;I was only robbin&rsquo; the register, I hope you understand<br />
      I saw them leavin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he says, and he stops<br />
      &ldquo;One of us had better call up the cops&rdquo;<br />
      And so Patty calls the cops<br />
      And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin&rsquo;<br />
      In the hot New Jersey night</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, far away in another part of town<br />
      Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin&rsquo; around<br />
      Number one contender for the middleweight crown<br />
      Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down<br />
      When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road<br />
      Just like the time before and the time before that<br />
      In Paterson that&rsquo;s just the way things go<br />
      If you&rsquo;re black you might as well not show up on the street<br />
      &rsquo;Less you wanna draw the heat</p>
    <p>Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops<br />
      Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin&rsquo; around<br />
      He said, &ldquo;I saw two men runnin&rsquo; out, they looked like middleweights<br />
      They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates&rdquo;<br />
      And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head<br />
      Cop said, &ldquo;Wait a minute, boys, this one&rsquo;s not dead&rdquo;<br />
      So they took him to the infirmary<br />
      And though this man could hardly see<br />
      They told him that he could identify the guilty men</p>
    <p>Four in the mornin&rsquo; and they haul Rubin in<br />
      Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs<br />
      The wounded man looks up through his one dyin&rsquo; eye<br />
      Says, &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;d you bring him in here for? He ain&rsquo;t the guy!&rdquo;<br />
      Yes, here&rsquo;s the story of the Hurricane<br />
      The man the authorities came to blame<br />
      For somethin&rsquo; that he never done<br />
      Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br />
      The champion of the world</p>
    <p>Four months later, the ghettos are in flame<br />
      Rubin&rsquo;s in South America, fightin&rsquo; for his name<br />
      While Arthur Dexter Bradley&rsquo;s still in the robbery game<br />
      And the cops are puttin&rsquo; the screws to him, lookin&rsquo; for somebody to blame<br />
      &ldquo;Remember that murder that happened in a bar?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Remember you said you saw the getaway car?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;d like to play ball with the law?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin&rsquo; that night?&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that you are white&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Arthur Dexter Bradley said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not sure&rdquo;<br />
      Cops said, &ldquo;A poor boy like you could use a break<br />
      We got you for the motel job and we&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; to your friend Bello<br />
      Now you don&rsquo;t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow<br />
      You&rsquo;ll be doin&rsquo; society a favor<br />
      That sonofabitch is brave and gettin&rsquo; braver<br />
      We want to put his ass in stir<br />
      We want to pin this triple murder on him<br />
      He ain&rsquo;t no Gentleman Jim&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Rubin could take a man out with just one punch<br />
      But he never did like to talk about it all that much<br />
      It&rsquo;s my work, he&rsquo;d say, and I do it for pay<br />
      And when it&rsquo;s over I&rsquo;d just as soon go on my way<br />
      Up to some paradise<br />
      Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice<br />
      And ride a horse along a trail<br />
      But then they took him to the jailhouse<br />
      Where they try to turn a man into a mouse</p>
    <p>All of Rubin&rsquo;s cards were marked in advance<br />
      The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance<br />
      The judge made Rubin&rsquo;s witnesses drunkards from the slums<br />
      To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum<br />
      And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger<br />
      No one doubted that he pulled the trigger<br />
      And though they could not produce the gun<br />
      The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed<br />
      And the all-white jury agreed</p>
    <p>Rubin Carter was falsely tried<br />
      The crime was murder &ldquo;one,&rdquo; guess who testified?<br />
      Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied<br />
      And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride<br />
      How can the life of such a man<br />
      Be in the palm of some fool&rsquo;s hand?<br />
      To see him obviously framed<br />
      Couldn&rsquo;t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land<br />
      Where justice is a game</p>
    <p>Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties<br />
      Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise<br />
      While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell<br />
      An innocent man in a living hell<br />
      That&rsquo;s the story of the Hurricane<br />
      But it won&rsquo;t be over till they clear his name<br />
      And give him back the time he&rsquo;s done<br />
      Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been<br />
      The champion of the world</p>
