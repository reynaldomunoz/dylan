    <p>I married Isis on the fifth day of May<br />
      But I could not hold on to her very long<br />
      So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away<br />
      For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong</p>
    <p>I came to a high place of darkness and light<br />
      The dividing line ran through the center of town<br />
      I hitched up my pony to a post on the right<br />
      Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down</p>
    <p>A man in the corner approached me for a match<br />
      I knew right away he was not ordinary<br />
      He said, &ldquo;Are you lookin&rsquo; for somethin&rsquo; easy to catch?&rdquo;<br />
      I said, &ldquo;I got no money.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t necessary&rdquo;</p>
    <p>We set out that night for the cold in the North<br />
      I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word<br />
      I said, &ldquo;Where are we goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; He said we&rsquo;d be back by the fourth<br />
      I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best news that I&rsquo;ve ever heard&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I was thinkin&rsquo; about turquoise, I was thinkin&rsquo; about gold<br />
      I was thinkin&rsquo; about diamonds and the world&rsquo;s biggest necklace<br />
      As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold<br />
      I was thinkin&rsquo; about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless</p>
    <p>How she told me that one day we would meet up again<br />
      And things would be different the next time we wed<br />
      If I only could hang on and just be her friend<br />
      I still can&rsquo;t remember all the best things she said</p>
    <p>We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice<br />
      He said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a body I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to find<br />
      If I carry it out it&rsquo;ll bring a good price&rdquo;<br />
      &rsquo;Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind</p>
    <p>The wind it was howlin&rsquo; and the snow was outrageous<br />
      We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn<br />
      When he died I was hopin&rsquo; that it wasn&rsquo;t contagious<br />
      But I made up my mind that I had to go on</p>
    <p>I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty<br />
      There was no jewels, no nothin&rsquo;, I felt I&rsquo;d been had<br />
      When I saw that my partner was just bein&rsquo; friendly<br />
      When I took up his offer I must-a been mad</p>
    <p>I picked up his body and I dragged him inside<br />
      Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover<br />
      I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied<br />
      Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her</p>
    <p>She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise<br />
      Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed<br />
      I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes<br />
      I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead</p>
    <p>She said, &ldquo;Where ya been?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No place special&rdquo;<br />
      She said, &ldquo;You look different.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, not quite&rdquo;<br />
      She said, &ldquo;You been gone.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only natural&rdquo;<br />
      She said, &ldquo;You gonna stay?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yeah, I jes might&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child<br />
      What drives me to you is what drives me insane<br />
      I still can remember the way that you smiled<br />
      On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin&rsquo; rain</p>
