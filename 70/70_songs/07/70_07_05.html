      Gonna change my way of thinking<br />
      Make myself a different set of rules<br />
      Gonna put my good foot forward<br />

      Sons becoming husbands to their mothers<br />

      Well don&rsquo;t know which one is worse<br />
      Doing your own thing or just being cool<br />
      You remember only about the brass ring<br />

      You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes<br />
      You can mislead a man<br />

      One I can easily afford<br />
      I got a God-fearing woman<br />
      One I can easily afford<br />
      She can do the Georgia crawl<br />
      She can walk in the spirit of the Lord</p>

      For you know not the hour in which I come&rdquo;<br />

      For you know not the hour in which I come&rdquo;<br />
      He said, &ldquo;He who is not for Me is against Me&rdquo;<br />
      Just so you know where He&rsquo;s coming from</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a kingdom called Heaven<br />
      A place where there is no pain of birth<br />
