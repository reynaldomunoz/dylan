    <p>I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love<br />
      I love you more than money and more than the stars above<br />
      Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea<br />
      Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me</p>
    <p>Ever since you walked right in, the circle&rsquo;s been complete<br />
      I&rsquo;ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street<br />
      To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun<br />
      I love you more than ever and I haven&rsquo;t yet begun</p>
    <p>You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live<br />
      When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give<br />
      Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole<br />
      Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul</p>
    <p>You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life<br />
      Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife<br />
      My thoughts of you don&rsquo;t ever rest, they&rsquo;d kill me if I lie<br />
      I&rsquo;d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die</p>
    <p>The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth<br />
      We&rsquo;ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth<br />
      What&rsquo;s lost is lost, we can&rsquo;t regain what went down in the flood<br />
      But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s never been my duty to remake the world at large<br />
      Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge<br />
      &rsquo;Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn&rsquo;t bend<br />
      And if there is eternity I&rsquo;d love you there again</p>
    <p>Oh, can&rsquo;t you see that you were born to stand by my side<br />
      And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride<br />
      You&rsquo;re the other half of what I am, you&rsquo;re the missing piece<br />
      And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn&rsquo;t cease</p>
    <p>You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see<br />
      Just bein&rsquo; next to you is a natural thing for me<br />
      And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on<br />
      &lsquo;Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone</p>
