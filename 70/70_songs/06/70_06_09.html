   <div id="song">
    <p>There&rsquo;s a long-distance train rolling through the rain<br />
      Tears on the letter I write<br />
      There&rsquo;s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much<br />
      But she&rsquo;s drifting like a satellite</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze<br />
      Laughter down on Elizabeth Street<br />
      And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone<br />
      Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat</p>
    <p>Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise<br />
      But he practiced what he preached from the heart<br />
      A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me<br />
      The time and the place that the trouble would start</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage<br />
      And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage<br />
      And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page<br />
      Of a book that no one can write<br />
      Oh, where are you tonight?</p>
    <p>The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure<br />
      To live it you have to explode<br />
      In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed<br />
      Sacrifice was the code of the road</p>
    <p>I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John<br />
      Strong men belittled by doubt<br />
      I couldn&rsquo;t tell her what my private thoughts were<br />
      But she had some way of finding them out</p>
    <p>He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same<br />
      She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf<br />
      She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair<br />
      And discovered her invisible self</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a lion in the road, there&rsquo;s a demon escaped<br />
      There&rsquo;s a million dreams gone, there&rsquo;s a landscape being raped<br />
      As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape<br />
      I won&rsquo;t but then again, maybe I might<br />
      Oh, if I could just find you tonight</p>
    <p>I fought with my twin, that enemy within<br />
      &rsquo;Til both of us fell by the way<br />
      Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees<br />
      While the law looks the other way</p>
    <p>Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes<br />
      The guy you were lovin&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t stay clean<br />
      It felt outa place, my foot in his face<br />
      But he should-a stayed where his money was green</p>
    <p>I bit into the root of forbidden fruit<br />
      With the juice running down my leg<br />
      Then I dealt with your boss, who&rsquo;d never known about loss<br />
      And who always was too proud to beg</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room<br />
      And a pathway that leads up to the stars<br />
      If you don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a price for this sweet paradise<br />
      Remind me to show you the scars</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a new day at dawn and I&rsquo;ve finally arrived<br />
      If I&rsquo;m there in the morning, baby, you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;ve survived<br />
      I can&rsquo;t believe it, I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m alive<br />
      But without you it just doesn&rsquo;t seem right<br />
      Oh, where are you tonight?</p>
