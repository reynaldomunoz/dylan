    <p>In death, you face life with a child and a wife<br />
      Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls<br />
      You&rsquo;re a soldier of mercy, you&rsquo;re cold and you curse<br />
      &ldquo;He who cannot be trusted must fall&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety<br />
      You fight for the throne and you travel alone<br />
      Unknown as you slowly sink<br />
      And there&rsquo;s no time to think</p>
    <p>In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity<br />
      In secret, for pieces of change<br />
      The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you<br />
      And it makes you feel violent and strange</p>
    <p>Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy<br />
      Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss<br />
      In the valley of the missing link<br />
      And you have no time to think</p>
    <p>Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you<br />
      Her worst is better than best<br />
      I&rsquo;ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes<br />
      And I feel so depressed</p>
    <p>China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality<br />
      Mercury rules you and destiny fools you<br />
      Like the plague, with a dangerous wink<br />
      And there&rsquo;s no time to think</p>
    <p>Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you<br />
      Where the lion lies down with the lamb<br />
      I&rsquo;d have paid off the traitor and killed him much later<br />
      But that&rsquo;s just the way that I am</p>
    <p>Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality<br />
      But the magician is quicker and his game<br />
      Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink<br />
      And there&rsquo;s no time to think</p>
    <p>Anger and jealousy&rsquo;s all that he sells us<br />
      He&rsquo;s content when you&rsquo;re under his thumb<br />
      Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him<br />
      To survive it you play deaf and dumb</p>
    <p>Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity<br />
      You glance through the mirror and there&rsquo;s eyes staring clear<br />
      At the back of your head as you drink<br />
      And there&rsquo;s no time to think</p>
    <p>Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow<br />
      Will offer their heads for a prayer<br />
      You can&rsquo;t find no salvation, you have no expectations<br />
      Anytime, anyplace, anywhere</p>
    <p>Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility<br />
      You know you can&rsquo;t keep her and the water gets deeper<br />
      That is leading you onto the brink<br />
      But there&rsquo;s no time to think</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity<br />
      For pleasure you must now resist<br />
      Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you<br />
      They&rsquo;re not even sure you exist</p>
    <p>Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism<br />
      Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws<br />
      And the sound of the keys as they clink<br />
      But there&rsquo;s no time to think</p>
    <p>The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl<br />
      With the rose in her hair<br />
      Starlight in the East and you&rsquo;re finally released<br />
      You&rsquo;re stranded but with nothing to share</p>
    <p>Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity<br />
      You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille<br />
      &rsquo;Neath the moon shinin&rsquo; bloody and pink<br />
      And there&rsquo;s no time to think</p>
    <p>Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you<br />
      But no, you will not be deceived<br />
      Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt<br />
      You can give but you cannot receive</p>
    <p>No time to choose when the truth must die<br />
      No time to lose or say goodbye<br />
      No time to prepare for the victim that&rsquo;s there<br />
      No time to suffer or blink<br />
      And no time to think</p>
