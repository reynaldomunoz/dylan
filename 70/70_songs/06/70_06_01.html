    <p>Sixteen years<br />
      Sixteen banners united over the field<br />
      Where the good shepherd grieves<br />
      Desperate men, desperate women divided<br />
      Spreading their wings &rsquo;neath the falling leaves</p>
    <p>Fortune calls<br />
      I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace<br />
      Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down<br />
      She&rsquo;s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born<br />
      On midsummer&rsquo;s eve, near the tower</p>
    <p>The cold-blooded moon<br />
      The captain waits above the celebration<br />
      Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid<br />
      Whose ebony face is beyond communication<br />
      The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid</p>
    <p>They shaved her head<br />
      She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo<br />
      A messenger arrived with a black nightingale<br />
      I seen her on the stairs and I couldn&rsquo;t help but follow<br />
      Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil</p>
    <p>I stumbled to my feet<br />
      I rode past destruction in the ditches<br />
      With the stitches still mending &rsquo;neath a heart-shaped tattoo<br />
      Renegade priests and treacherous young witches<br />
      Were handing out the flowers that I&rsquo;d given to you</p>
    <p>The palace of mirrors<br />
      Where dog soldiers are reflected<br />
      The endless road and the wailing of chimes<br />
      The empty rooms where her memory is protected<br />
      Where the angels&rsquo; voices whisper to the souls of previous times</p>
    <p>She wakes him up<br />
      Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking<br />
      Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks<br />
      She&rsquo;s begging to know what measures he now will be taking<br />
      He&rsquo;s pulling her down and she&rsquo;s clutching on to his long golden locks</p>
    <p>Gentlemen, he said<br />
      I don&rsquo;t need your organization, I&rsquo;ve shined your shoes<br />
      I&rsquo;ve moved your mountains and marked your cards<br />
      But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination<br />
      Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards</p>
    <p>Peace will come<br />
      With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire<br />
      But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall<br />
      And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating<br />
      Between the King and the Queen of Swords</p>
