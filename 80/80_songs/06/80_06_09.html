    <p>What was it you wanted?<br />
      Tell me again so I&rsquo;ll know<br />
      What&rsquo;s happening in there<br />
      What&rsquo;s going on in your show<br />
      What was it you wanted<br />
      Could you say it again?<br />
      I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute<br />
      You can get it together by then</p>
    <p>What was it you wanted<br />
      You can tell me, I&rsquo;m back<br />
      We can start it all over<br />
      Get it back on the track<br />
      You got my attention<br />
      Go ahead, speak<br />
      What was it you wanted<br />
      When you were kissing my cheek?</p>
    <p>Was there somebody looking<br />
      When you give me that kiss<br />
      Someone there in the shadows<br />
      Someone that I might have missed?<br />
      Is there something you needed<br />
      Something I don&rsquo;t understand<br />
      What was it you wanted<br />
      Do I have it here in my hand?</p>
    <p>Whatever you wanted<br />
      Slipped out of my mind<br />
      Would you remind me again<br />
      If you&rsquo;d be so kind<br />
      Has the record been breaking<br />
      Did the needle just skip<br />
      Is there somebody waiting<br />
      Was there a slip of the lip?</p>
    <p>What was it you wanted<br />
      I ain&rsquo;t keeping score<br />
      Are you the same person<br />
      That was here before?<br />
      Is it something important?<br />
      Maybe not<br />
      What was it you wanted?<br />
      Tell me again I forgot</p>
    <p>Whatever you wanted<br />
      What could it be<br />
      Did somebody tell you<br />
      That you could get it from me<br />
      Is it something that comes natural<br />
      Is it easy to say<br />
      Why do you want it<br />
      Who are you anyway?</p>
    <p>Is the scenery changing<br />
      Am I getting it wrong<br />
      Is the whole thing going backwards<br />
      Are they playing our song?<br />
      Where were you when it started<br />
      Do you want it for free<br />
      What was it you wanted<br />
      Are you talking to me?</p>
