    <p>There was a little boy and there was a little girl<br />
      And they lived in an alley under the red sky<br />
      There was a little boy and there was a little girl<br />
      And they lived in an alley under the red sky</p>
    <p>There was an old man and he lived in the moon<br />
      One summer&rsquo;s day he came passing by<br />
      There was an old man and he lived in the moon<br />
      And one day he came passing by</p>
    <p>Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new<br />
      Someday little girl, you&rsquo;ll have a diamond as big as your shoe</p>
    <p>Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high<br />
      One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie<br />
      Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high<br />
      One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie</p>
    <p>This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town<br />
      This is the blind horse that leads you around</p>
    <p>Let the bird sing, let the bird fly<br />
      One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry<br />
      Let the bird sing, let the bird fly<br />
      The man in the moon went home and the river went dry</p>
