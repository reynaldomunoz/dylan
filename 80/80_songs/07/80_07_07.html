    <p>One by one, they followed the sun<br />
      One by one, until there were none<br />
      Two by two, to their lovers they flew<br />
      Two by two, into the foggy dew<br />
      Three by three, they danced on the sea<br />
      Four by four, they danced on the shore<br />
      Five by five, they tried to survive<br />
      Six by six, they were playing with tricks</p>
    <p>How many paths did they try and fail?<br />
      How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?<br />
      How much poison did they inhale?<br />
      How many black cats crossed their trail?</p>
    <p>Seven by seven, they headed for heaven<br />
      Eight by eight, they got to the gate<br />
      Nine by nine, they drank the wine<br />
      Ten by ten, they drank it again</p>
    <p>How many tomorrows have they given away?<br />
      How many compared to yesterday?<br />
      How many more without any reward?<br />
      How many more can they afford?</p>
    <p>Two by two, they stepped into the ark<br />
      Two by two, they step in the dark<br />
      Three by three, they&rsquo;re turning the key<br />
      Four by four, they turn it some more</p>
    <p>One by one, they follow the sun<br />
      Two by two, to another rendezvous</p>
