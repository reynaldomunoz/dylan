    <p>One time in London I&rsquo;d gone out for a walk<br />
      Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk<br />
      &rsquo;Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view<br />
      To anyone passing by, that&rsquo;s who they&rsquo;re talking to</p>
    <p>There was someone on a platform talking to the folks<br />
      About the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes<br />
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bright a light,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for anybody&rsquo;s eyes<br />
      If you&rsquo;ve never seen one it&rsquo;s a blessing in disguise&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I moved in closer, got up on my toes<br />
      Two men in front of me were coming to blows<br />
      The man was saying something &rsquo;bout children when they&rsquo;re young<br />
      Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The news of the day is on all the time<br />
      All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme<br />
      Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free<br />
      Don&rsquo;t let an egg get laid in it by something you can&rsquo;t see&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Pray for peace!&rdquo; he said. You could feel it in the crowd<br />
      My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud<br />
      &ldquo;It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone<br />
      No one can protect you from it once you turn it on&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It will lead you into some strange pursuits<br />
      Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits<br />
      It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about<br />
      Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all been designed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to make you lose your mind<br />
      And when you go back to find it, there&rsquo;s nothing there to find<br />
      Every time you look at it, your situation&rsquo;s worse<br />
      If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse&quot;</p>
    <p>The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man<br />
      There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran<br />
      The T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me<br />
      Later on that evening, I watched it on T.V.</p>
