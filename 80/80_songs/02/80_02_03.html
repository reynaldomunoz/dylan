    <p>Well, the neighborhood bully, he&rsquo;s just one man<br />
      His enemies say he&rsquo;s on their land<br />
      They got him outnumbered about a million to one<br />
      He got no place to escape to, no place to run<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>The neighborhood bully just lives to survive<br />
      He&rsquo;s criticized and condemned for being alive<br />
      He&rsquo;s not supposed to fight back, he&rsquo;s supposed to have thick skin<br />
      He&rsquo;s supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land<br />
      He&rsquo;s wandered the earth an exiled man<br />
      Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn<br />
      He&rsquo;s always on trial for just being born<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized<br />
      Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.<br />
      Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad<br />
      The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>Well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim<br />
      That he&rsquo;ll live by the rules that the world makes for him<br />
      &rsquo;Cause there&rsquo;s a noose at his neck and a gun at his back<br />
      And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>He got no allies to really speak of<br />
      What he gets he must pay for, he don&rsquo;t get it out of love<br />
      He buys obsolete weapons and he won&rsquo;t be denied<br />
      But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>Well, he&rsquo;s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace<br />
      They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease<br />
      Now, they wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep<br />
      They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>Every empire that&rsquo;s enslaved him is gone<br />
      Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon<br />
      He&rsquo;s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand<br />
      In bed with nobody, under no one&rsquo;s command<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>Now his holiest books have been trampled upon<br />
      No contract he signed was worth what it was written on<br />
      He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth<br />
      Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s anybody indebted to him for?<br />
      Nothin&rsquo;, they say. He just likes to cause war<br />
      Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed<br />
      They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed<br />
      He&rsquo;s the neighborhood bully</p>
    <p>What has he done to wear so many scars?<br />
      Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?<br />
      Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill<br />
      Running out the clock, time standing still<br />
      Neighborhood bully</p>
