    <p>Look out your window, baby, there&rsquo;s a scene you&rsquo;d like to catch<br />
      The band is playing &ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; a man got his hand outstretched<br />
      Could be the Führer<br />
      Could be the local priest<br />
      You know sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace</p>
    <p>He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue<br />
      He knows every song of love that ever has been sung<br />
      Good intentions can be evil<br />
      Both hands can be full of grease<br />
      You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace</p>
    <p>Well, first he&rsquo;s in the background, then he&rsquo;s in the front<br />
      Both eyes are looking like they&rsquo;re on a rabbit hunt<br />
      Nobody can see through him<br />
      No, not even the Chief of Police<br />
      You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace</p>
    <p>Well, he catch you when you&rsquo;re hoping for a glimpse of the sun<br />
      Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton<br />
      He could be standing next to you<br />
      The person that you&rsquo;d notice least<br />
      I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace</p>
    <p>Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull<br />
      He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull<br />
      I can smell something cooking<br />
      I can tell there&rsquo;s going to be a feast<br />
      You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace</p>
    <p>He&rsquo;s a great humanitarian, he&rsquo;s a great philanthropist<br />
      He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed<br />
      He&rsquo;ll put both his arms around you<br />
      You can feel the tender touch of the beast<br />
      You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace</p>
    <p>Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl<br />
      Trees that&rsquo;ve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall<br />
      Wanna get married? Do it now<br />
      Tomorrow all activity will cease<br />
      You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace</p>
    <p>Somewhere Mama&rsquo;s weeping for her blue-eyed boy<br />
      She&rsquo;s holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy<br />
      And he&rsquo;s following a star<br />
      The same one them three men followed from the East<br />
      I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace</p>
