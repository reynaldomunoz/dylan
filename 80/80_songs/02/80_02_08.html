    <p>Just a minute before you leave, girl<br />
      Just a minute before you touch the door<br />
      What is it that you&rsquo;re trying to achieve, girl?<br />
      Do you think we can talk about it some more?<br />
      You know, the streets are filled with vipers<br />
      Who&rsquo;ve lost all ray of hope<br />
      You know, it ain&rsquo;t even safe no more<br />
      In the palace of the Pope</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t fall apart on me tonight<br />
      I just don&rsquo;t think that I could handle it<br />
      Don&rsquo;t fall apart on me tonight<br />
      Yesterday&rsquo;s just a memory<br />
      Tomorrow is never what it&rsquo;s supposed to be<br />
      And I need you, yeah</p>
    <p>Come over here from over there, girl<br />
      Sit down here. You can have my chair<br />
      I can&rsquo;t see us goin&rsquo; anywhere, girl<br />
      The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can&rsquo;t take you there<br />
      I wish I&rsquo;d have been a doctor<br />
      Maybe I&rsquo;d have saved some life that had been lost<br />
      Maybe I&rsquo;d have done some good in the world<br />
      &rsquo;Stead of burning every bridge I crossed</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t fall apart on me tonight<br />
      I just don&rsquo;t think that I could handle it<br />
      Don&rsquo;t fall apart on me tonight<br />
      Yesterday&rsquo;s just a memory<br />
      Tomorrow is never what it&rsquo;s supposed to be<br />
      And I need you, oh, yeah</p>
    <p>I ain&rsquo;t too good at conversation, girl<br />
      So you might not know exactly how I feel<br />
      But if I could, I&rsquo;d bring you to the mountaintop, girl<br />
      And build you a house made out of stainless steel<br />
      But it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m stuck inside a painting<br />
      That&rsquo;s hanging in the Louvre<br />
      My throat start to tickle and my nose itches<br />
      But I know that I can&rsquo;t move</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t fall apart on me tonight<br />
      I just don&rsquo;t think that I could handle it<br />
      Don&rsquo;t fall apart on me tonight<br />
      Yesterday&rsquo;s gone but the past lives on<br />
      Tomorrow&rsquo;s just one step beyond<br />
      And I need you, oh, yeah</p>
    <p>Who are these people who are walking towards you?<br />
      Do you know them or will there be a fight?<br />
      With their humorless smiles so easy to see through<br />
      Can they tell you what&rsquo;s wrong from what&rsquo;s right?<br />
      Do you remember St. James Street<br />
      Where you blew Jackie P.&rsquo;s mind?<br />
      You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet<br />
      And laid his life on the line</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl<br />
      No more booby traps and bombs<br />
      No more decadence and charm<br />
      No more affection that&rsquo;s misplaced, girl<br />
      No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms<br />
      What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?<br />
      He looked so baffled and so bewildered<br />
      When he played and we didn&rsquo;t dance</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t fall apart on me tonight<br />
      I just don&rsquo;t think that I could handle it<br />
      Don&rsquo;t fall apart on me tonight<br />
      Yesterday&rsquo;s just a memory<br />
      Tomorrow is never what it&rsquo;s supposed to be<br />
      And I need you, yeah</p>
