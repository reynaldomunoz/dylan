    <p>Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore<br />
      My flashlight&rsquo;s from Taiwan<br />
      My tablecloth&rsquo;s from Malaysia<br />
      My belt buckle&rsquo;s from the Amazon<br />
      You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines<br />
      And the car I drive is a Chevrolet<br />
      It was put together down in Argentina<br />
      By a guy makin&rsquo; thirty cents a day</p>
    <p>Well, it&rsquo;s sundown on the union<br />
      And what&rsquo;s made in the U.S.A.<br />
      Sure was a good idea<br />
      &rsquo;Til greed got in the way</p>
    <p>Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong<br />
      And the pearls are from Japan<br />
      Well, the dog collar&rsquo;s from India<br />
      And the flower pot&rsquo;s from Pakistan<br />
      All the furniture, it says &ldquo;Made in Brazil&rdquo;<br />
      Where a woman, she slaved for sure<br />
      Bringin&rsquo; home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve<br />
      You know, that&rsquo;s a lot of money to her</p>
    <p>Well, it&rsquo;s sundown on the union<br />
      And what&rsquo;s made in the U.S.A.<br />
      Sure was a good idea<br />
      &rsquo;Til greed got in the way</p>
    <p>Well, you know, lots of people complainin&rsquo; that there is no work<br />
      I say, &ldquo;Why you say that for<br />
      When nothin&rsquo; you got is U.S.–made?&rdquo;<br />
      They don&rsquo;t make nothin&rsquo; here no more<br />
      You know, capitalism is above the law<br />
      It say, &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t count &rsquo;less it sells&rdquo;<br />
      When it costs too much to build it at home<br />
      You just build it cheaper someplace else</p>
    <p>Well, it&rsquo;s sundown on the union<br />
      And what&rsquo;s made in the U.S.A.<br />
      Sure was a good idea<br />
      &rsquo;Til greed got in the way</p>
    <p>Well, the job that you used to have<br />
      They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador<br />
      The unions are big business, friend<br />
      And they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; out like a dinosaur<br />
      They used to grow food in Kansas<br />
      Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw<br />
      I can see the day coming when even your home garden<br />
      Is gonna be against the law</p>
    <p>Well, it&rsquo;s sundown on the union<br />
      And what&rsquo;s made in the U.S.A.<br />
      Sure was a good idea<br />
      &rsquo;Til greed got in the way</p>
    <p>Democracy don&rsquo;t rule the world<br />
      You&rsquo;d better get that in your head<br />
      This world is ruled by violence<br />
      But I guess that&rsquo;s better left unsaid<br />
      From Broadway to the Milky Way<br />
      That&rsquo;s a lot of territory indeed<br />
      And a man&rsquo;s gonna do what he has to do<br />
      When he&rsquo;s got a hungry mouth to feed</p>
    <p>Well, it&rsquo;s sundown on the union<br />
      And what&rsquo;s made in the U.S.A.<br />
      Sure was a good idea<br />
      &rsquo;Til greed got in the way</p>
