    <p>Man thinks &rsquo;cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please<br />
      And if things don&rsquo;t change soon, he will<br />
      Oh, man has invented his doom<br />
      First step was touching the moon</p>
    <p>Now, there&rsquo;s a woman on my block<br />
      She just sit there as the night grows still<br />
      She say who gonna take away his license to kill?</p>
    <p>Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life<br />
      And they set him on a path where he&rsquo;s bound to get ill<br />
      Then they bury him with stars<br />
      Sell his body like they do used cars</p>
    <p>Now, there&rsquo;s a woman on my block<br />
      She just sit there facin&rsquo; the hill<br />
      She say who gonna take away his license to kill?</p>
    <p>Now, he&rsquo;s hell-bent for destruction, he&rsquo;s afraid and confused<br />
      And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill<br />
      All he believes are his eyes<br />
      And his eyes, they just tell him lies</p>
    <p>But there&rsquo;s a woman on my block<br />
      Sitting there in a cold chill<br />
      She say who gonna take away his license to kill?</p>
    <p>Ya may be a noisemaker, spirit maker<br />
      Heartbreaker, backbreaker<br />
      Leave no stone unturned<br />
      May be an actor in a plot<br />
      That might be all that you got<br />
      &rsquo;Til your error you clearly learn</p>
    <p>Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool<br />
      And when he sees his reflection, he&rsquo;s fulfilled<br />
      Oh, man is opposed to fair play<br />
      He wants it all and he wants it his way</p>
    <p>Now, there&rsquo;s a woman on my block<br />
      She just sit there as the night grows still<br />
      She say who gonna take away his license to kill?</p>
