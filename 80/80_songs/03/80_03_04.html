    <p>Everybody wants to know why he couldn&rsquo;t adjust<br />
      Adjust to what, a dream that bust?</p>
    <p>He was a clean-cut kid<br />
      But they made a killer out of him<br />
      That&rsquo;s what they did</p>
    <p>They said what&rsquo;s up is down, they said what isn&rsquo;t is<br />
      They put ideas in his head he thought were his</p>
    <p>He was a clean-cut kid<br />
      But they made a killer out of him<br />
      That&rsquo;s what they did</p>
    <p>He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band<br />
      When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand</p>
    <p>He was a clean-cut kid<br />
      But they made a killer out of him<br />
      That&rsquo;s what they did</p>
    <p>He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout<br />
      For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out</p>
    <p>He was a clean-cut kid<br />
      But they made a killer out of him<br />
      That&rsquo;s what they did</p>
    <p>They said, &ldquo;Listen boy, you&rsquo;re just a pup&rdquo;<br />
      They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up</p>
    <p>They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills<br />
      A jeep to drive, blood to spill</p>
    <p>They said &ldquo;Congratulations, you got what it takes&rdquo;<br />
      They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes</p>
    <p>He was a clean-cut kid<br />
      But they made a killer out of him<br />
      That&rsquo;s what they did</p>
    <p>He bought the American dream but it put him in debt<br />
      The only game he could play was Russian roulette</p>
    <p>He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread<br />
      Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed</p>
    <p>He went to Hollywood to see Peter O&rsquo;Toole<br />
      He stole a Rolls-Royce and drove it in a swimming pool</p>
    <p>They took a clean-cut kid<br />
      And they made a killer out of him<br />
      That&rsquo;s what they did</p>
    <p>He could&rsquo;ve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar<br />
      Could&rsquo;ve been an accountant or a tennis star</p>
    <p>He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day<br />
      Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay</p>
    <p>His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans<br />
      They gotta sleep together in a home they don&rsquo;t own</p>
    <p>They took a clean-cut kid<br />
      And they made a killer out of him<br />
      That&rsquo;s what they did</p>
    <p>Well, everybody&rsquo;s asking why he couldn&rsquo;t adjust<br />
      All he ever wanted was somebody to trust</p>
    <p>They took his head and turned it inside out<br />
      He never did know what it was all about</p>
    <p>He had a steady job, he joined the choir<br />
      He never did plan to walk the high wire</p>
    <p>They took a clean-cut kid<br />
      And they made a killer out of him<br />
      That&rsquo;s what they did</p>
