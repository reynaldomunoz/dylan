    <p>Well, there was this movie I seen one time<br />
      About a man riding &rsquo;cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck<br />
      He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself<br />
      The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck</p>
    <p>Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp<br />
      As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath<br />
      &ldquo;Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square<br />
      I want him to feel what it&rsquo;s like to every moment face his death&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in<br />
      And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain<br />
      You know I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve lived so long and are still so far apart<br />
      The memory of you keeps callin&rsquo; after me like a rollin&rsquo; train</p>
    <p>I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert<br />
      In your busted down Ford and your platform heels<br />
      I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet<br />
      Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel</p>
    <p>Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton&rsquo;<br />
      And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft<br />
      Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back<br />
      I would have gone on after you but I didn&rsquo;t feel like letting my head get blown off</p>
    <p>Well, we&rsquo;re drivin&rsquo; this car and the sun is comin&rsquo; up over the Rockies<br />
      Now I know she ain&rsquo;t you but she&rsquo;s here and she&rsquo;s got that dark rhythm in her soul<br />
      But I&rsquo;m too over the edge and I ain&rsquo;t in the mood anymore to remember the times<br />
      when I was your only man<br />
      And she don&rsquo;t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control</p>
    <p>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br />
      Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br />
      Brownsville girl, show me all around the world<br />
      Brownsville girl, you&rsquo;re my honey love</p>
    <p>Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo<br />
      We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin&rsquo; lot outside of town about a mile<br />
      Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust<br />
      She said, &ldquo;Henry ain&rsquo;t here but you can come on in, he&rsquo;ll be back in a little while&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin&rsquo; of<br />
      bummin&rsquo; a ride back to from where she started<br />
      But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up<br />
      She said, &ldquo;Welcome to the land of the living dead&rdquo;<br />
      You could tell she was so broken hearted<br />
      She said, &ldquo;Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;How far are y&rsquo;all going?&rdquo; Ruby asked us with a sigh<br />
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going all the way &rsquo;til the wheels fall off and burn<br />
      &rsquo;Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies&rdquo;<br />
      Ruby just smiled and said, &ldquo;Ah, you know some babies never learn&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Something about that movie though, well I just can&rsquo;t get it out of my head<br />
      But I can&rsquo;t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play<br />
      All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved<br />
      And a lot of them seemed to be lookin&rsquo; my way</p>
    <p>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,<br />
      Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br />
      Brownsville girl, show me all around the world<br />
      Brownsville girl, you&rsquo;re my honey love</p>
    <p>Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour<br />
      I was crossin&rsquo; the street when shots rang out<br />
      I didn&rsquo;t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran<br />
      &ldquo;We got him cornered in the churchyard,&rdquo; I heard somebody shout</p>
    <p>Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it,<br />
      it said, &ldquo;A man with no alibi&rdquo;<br />
      You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you<br />
      Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears<br />
      It was the best acting I saw anybody do</p>
    <p>Now I&rsquo;ve always been the kind of person that doesn&rsquo;t like to trespass<br />
      but sometimes you just find yourself over the line<br />
      Oh if there&rsquo;s an original thought out there, I could use it right now<br />
      You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; much. I could feel a whole lot better<br />
      If you were just here by my side to show me how</p>
    <p>Well, I&rsquo;m standin&rsquo; in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck<br />
      Yeah, but you know it&rsquo;s not the one that I had in mind<br />
      He&rsquo;s got a new one out now, I don&rsquo;t even know what it&rsquo;s about<br />
      But I&rsquo;ll see him in anything so I&rsquo;ll stand in line</p>
    <p>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br />
      Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br />
      Brownsville girl, show me all around the world<br />
      Brownsville girl, you&rsquo;re my honey love</p>
    <p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny how things never turn out the way you had &rsquo;em planned<br />
      The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn&rsquo;t Henry Porter<br />
      And you know there was somethin&rsquo; about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world<br />
      Just like you always said there was somethin&rsquo; about me you liked<br />
      that I left behind in the French Quarter</p>
    <p>Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content<br />
      I don&rsquo;t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I&rsquo;m gone<br />
      You always said people don&rsquo;t do what they believe in, they just do what&rsquo;s most convenient, then they repent<br />
      And I always said, &ldquo;Hang on to me, baby, and let&rsquo;s hope that the roof stays on&rdquo;</p>
    <p>There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice<br />
      I don&rsquo;t remember who I was or where I was bound<br />
      All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun<br />
      and he was shot in the back<br />
      Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down</p>
    <p>Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br />
      Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br />
      Brownsville girl, show me all around the world<br />
