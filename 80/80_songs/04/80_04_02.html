    <p>Maybe someday you&rsquo;ll be satisfied<br />
      When you&rsquo;ve lost everything you&rsquo;ll have nothing left to hide<br />
      When you&rsquo;re through running over things like you&rsquo;re walking &rsquo;cross the tracks<br />
      Maybe you&rsquo;ll beg me to take you back<br />
      Maybe someday you&rsquo;ll find out everybody&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s fool<br />
      Maybe then you&rsquo;ll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool<br />
      Maybe someday when you&rsquo;re by yourself alone<br />
      You&rsquo;ll know the love that I had for you was never my own</p>
    <p>Maybe someday you&rsquo;ll have nowhere to turn<br />
      You&rsquo;ll look back and wonder &rsquo;bout the bridges you have burned<br />
      You&rsquo;ll look back sometime when the lights grow dim<br />
      And you&rsquo;ll see you look much better with me than you do with him<br />
      Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns<br />
      Thirty pieces of silver, no money down<br />
      Maybe someday, you will understand<br />
      That something for nothing is everybody&rsquo;s plan</p>
    <p>Maybe someday you&rsquo;ll remember what you felt<br />
      When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt<br />
      When both of us, baby, were going through some sort of a test<br />
      Neither one of us could do what we do best<br />
      I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff<br />
      I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough<br />
      Maybe someday, you&rsquo;ll believe me when I say<br />
      That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way</p>
    <p>Maybe someday you&rsquo;ll hear a voice from on high<br />
      Sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?&rdquo;<br />
      Forgive me, baby, for what I didn&rsquo;t do<br />
      For not breakin&rsquo; down no bedroom door to get at you<br />
      Always was a sucker for the right cross<br />
      Never wanted to go home &rsquo;til the last cent was lost<br />
      Maybe someday you will look back and see<br />
      That I made it so easy for you to follow me</p>
    <p>Maybe someday there&rsquo;ll be nothing to tell<br />
      I&rsquo;m just as happy as you, baby, I just can&rsquo;t say it so well<br />
      Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike<br />
      There&rsquo;s no excuse for you to say that we don&rsquo;t think alike<br />
      You said you were goin&rsquo; to Frisco, stay a couple of months<br />
      I always like San Francisco, I was there for a party once<br />
      Maybe someday you&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s true<br />
      There was no greater love than what I had for you</p>
