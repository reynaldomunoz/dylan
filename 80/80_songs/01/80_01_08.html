    <p>I was in your presence for an hour or so<br />
      Or was it a day? I truly don&rsquo;t know<br />
      Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low<br />
      By that soft and shining sea<br />
      Did you respect me for what I did<br />
      Or for what I didn&rsquo;t do, or for keeping it hid?<br />
      Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid<br />
      Of everything you see?</p>
    <p>In the summertime, ah in the summertime<br />
      In the summertime, when you were with me</p>
    <p>I got the heart and you got the blood<br />
      We cut through iron and we cut through mud<br />
      Then came the warnin&rsquo; that was before the flood<br />
      That set everybody free<br />
      Fools they made a mock of sin<br />
      Our loyalty they tried to win<br />
      But you were closer to me than my next of kin<br />
      When they didn&rsquo;t want to know or see</p>
    <p>In the summertime, ah in the summertime<br />
      In the summertime when you were with me</p>
    <p>Strangers, they meddled in our affairs<br />
      Poverty and shame was theirs<br />
      But all that sufferin&rsquo; was not to be compared<br />
      With the glory that is to be<br />
      And I&rsquo;m still carrying the gift you gave<br />
      It&rsquo;s a part of me now, it&rsquo;s been cherished and saved<br />
      It&rsquo;ll be with me unto the grave<br />
      And then unto eternity</p>
    <p>In the summertime, ah in the summertime<br />
      In the summertime when you were with me</p>
