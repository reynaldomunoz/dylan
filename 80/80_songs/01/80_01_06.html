    <p>Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,<br />
      Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent<br />
      Felt around for the light switch, became nauseated.<br />
      She was walking down the hallway while the walls deteriorated.</p>
    <p>East of the Jordan, hard as the Rock of Gibraltar,<br />
      I see the burning of the page, Curtain risin' on a new age,<br />
      See the groom still waitin' at the altar.</p>
    <p>Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,<br />
      Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery,<br />
      Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me<br />
      About the madness of becomin' what one was never meant to be.</p>
    <p>West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,<br />
      I see the burning of the stage,<br />
      Curtain risin' on a new age,<br />
      See the groom still waitin' at the altar.</p>
    <p>Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt me,<br />
      Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me.<br />
      But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated.<br />
      I'd a-done anything for that woman if she didn't make me feel so obligated.</p>
    <p>West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,<br />
      I see the burning of the cage,<br />
      Curtain risin' on a new stage,<br />
      See the groom still waitin' at the altar.</p>
    <p>Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?<br />
      I see people who are supposed to know better standin' around like furniture.<br />
      There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it,<br />
      Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to<br />
      keep it.</p>
    <p>West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,<br />
      I see the burning of the stage, Curtain risin' on a new age,<br />
      See the groom still waitin' at the altar.</p>
    <p>Cities on fire, phones out of order,<br />
      They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.<br />
      What can I say about Claudette?<br />
      Ain't seen her since January,<br />
      She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.</p>
    <p>West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,<br />
      I see the burning of the stage,<br />
      Curtain risin' on a new age,<br />
      See the groom still waitin' at the altar.</p>
