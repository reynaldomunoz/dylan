    <p>Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on<br />
      Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon<br />
      He was an outlaw, that&rsquo;s for sure<br />
      More of an outlaw than you ever were<br />
      Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; on and on</p>
    <p>Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn&rsquo;t work out<br />
      But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin&rsquo; about<br />
      Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies&rsquo; heads<br />
      He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds<br />
      He&rsquo;s on some other shore, he didn&rsquo;t wanna live anymore</p>
    <p>Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn&rsquo;t commit any crime<br />
      He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time<br />
      I rode with him in a taxi once<br />
      Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months<br />
      Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone</p>
    <p>They said that he was sick &rsquo;cause he didn&rsquo;t play by the rules<br />
      He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools<br />
      They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts<br />
      He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts<br />
      Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had</p>
