    <p>Well my heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands gentle and fair<br />
      Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air<br />
      Bluebelles blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow<br />
      Well my heart&rsquo;s in the Highland<br />
      I&rsquo;m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go</p>
    <p>Windows were shakin&rsquo; all night in my dreams<br />
      Everything was exactly the way that it seems<br />
      Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page<br />
      Same ol&rsquo; rat race<br />
      Life in the same ol&rsquo; cage</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t want nothing from anyone, ain&rsquo;t that much to take<br />
      Wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake<br />
      Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery<br />
      I wish someone would come<br />
      And push back the clock for me</p>
    <p>Well my heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands wherever I roam<br />
      That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll be when I get called home<br />
      The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme<br />
      Well my heart&rsquo;s in the Highland<br />
      I can only get there one step at a time</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound<br />
      Someone&rsquo;s always yelling turn it down<br />
      Feel like I&rsquo;m drifting<br />
      Drifting from scene to scene<br />
      I&rsquo;m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?</p>
    <p>Insanity is smashing up against my soul<br />
      You can say I was on anything but a roll<br />
      If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top<br />
      What would I do with it anyway<br />
      Maybe take it to the pawn shop</p>
    <p>My heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands at the break of dawn<br />
      By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan<br />
      Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low<br />
      Well my heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands<br />
      Only place left to go</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m in Boston town, in some restaurant<br />
      I got no idea what I want<br />
      Well, maybe I do but I&rsquo;m just really not sure<br />
      Waitress comes over<br />
      Nobody in the place but me and her</p>
    <p>It must be a holiday, there&rsquo;s nobody around<br />
      She studies me closely as I sit down<br />
      She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs<br />
      She says, &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it be?&rdquo;<br />
      I say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, you got any soft boiled eggs?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>She looks at me, says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d bring you some<br />
      But we&rsquo;re out of &rsquo;m, you picked the wrong time to come&rdquo;<br />
      Then she says, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re an artist, draw a picture of me!&rdquo;<br />
      I say, &ldquo;I would if I could, but<br />
      I don&rsquo;t do sketches from memory&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here in front of you, or haven&rsquo;t you looked?&rdquo;<br />
      I say, &ldquo;All right, I know, but I don&rsquo;t have my drawing book!&rdquo;<br />
      She gives me a napkin, she says, &ldquo;You can do it on that&rdquo;<br />
      I say, &ldquo;Yes I could, but<br />
      I don&rsquo;t know where my pencil is at!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>She pulls one out from behind her ear<br />
      She says, &ldquo;All right now, go ahead, draw me, I&rsquo;m standing right here&rdquo;<br />
      I make a few lines and I show it for her to see<br />
      Well she takes the napkin and throws it back<br />
      And says, &ldquo;That don&rsquo;t look a thing like me!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>I said, &ldquo;Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does&rdquo;<br />
      She says, &ldquo;You must be jokin&rsquo;.&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;I wish I was!&rdquo;<br />
      Then she says, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t read women authors, do you?&rdquo;<br />
      Least that&rsquo;s what I think I hear her say<br />
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;how would you know and what would it matter anyway?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;you just don&rsquo;t seem like you do!&rdquo;<br />
      I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re way wrong&rdquo;<br />
      She says, &ldquo;Which ones have you read then?&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;I read Erica Jong!&rdquo;<br />
      She goes away for a minute<br />
      And I slide up out of my chair<br />
      I step outside back to the busy street but nobody&rsquo;s going anywhere</p>
    <p>Well my heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds<br />
      Way up in the border country, far from the towns<br />
      With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow<br />
      My heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands<br />
      Can&rsquo;t see any other way to go</p>
    <p>Every day is the same thing out the door<br />
      Feel further away than ever before<br />
      Some things in life, it gets too late to learn<br />
      Well, I&rsquo;m lost somewhere<br />
      I must have made a few bad turns</p>
    <p>I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes<br />
      They&rsquo;re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes<br />
      All the young men with their young women looking so good<br />
      Well, I&rsquo;d trade places with any of them<br />
      In a minute, if I could</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog<br />
      Talking to myself in a monologue<br />
      I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat<br />
      Somebody just asked me<br />
      If I registered to vote</p>
    <p>The sun is beginning to shine on me<br />
      But it&rsquo;s not like the sun that used to be<br />
      The party&rsquo;s over and there&rsquo;s less and less to say<br />
      I got new eyes<br />
      Everything looks far away</p>
    <p>Well, my heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands at the break of day<br />
      Over the hills and far away<br />
      There&rsquo;s a way to get there and I&rsquo;ll figure it out somehow<br />
      But I&rsquo;m already there in my mind<br />
      And that&rsquo;s good enough for now</p>
