      In Scarlet Town, where I was born<br />
      There's ivy leaf and silver thorn<br />
      The streets have names that you can't pronounce<br />
      Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce<br />
      The music starts and the people sway<br />
      Everybody says, &quot;Are you going my way? &quot;<br />
      Uncle Tom still workin' for Uncle Bill<br />
      Scarlet Town is under the hill.<br />
      <br />
      Scarlet Town in the month of May<br />
      Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay<br />
      Mistress Mary by the side of the bed<br />
      Kissin' his face and heapin' prayers on his head<br />
      So brave, so true, so gentle is he<br />
      I'll weep for him as he would weep for me<br />
      Little Boy Blue come your blow horn<br />
      In Scarlet Town, where I was born<br />
      <br />
      Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours,<br />
      There's palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers<br />
      Beggars crouching at the gate<br />
      Help comes, but it comes too late<br />
      By marble slabs and in fields of stone<br />
      You make your humble wishes known<br />
      I touched the garment, but the hem was torn<br />
      In Scarlet Town, where I was born<br />
      <br />
      In Scarlet Town, the end is near<br />
      The Seven Wonders of the World are here<br />
      The evil and the good livin' side by side<br />
      All human forms seem glorified<br />
      Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite<br />
      See who will hold you and kiss you good night<br />
      There's walnut groves and maplewood<br />
      In Scarlet Town cryin' won't do no good<br />
      <br />
      In Scarlet Town, you fight your father's foes<br />
      Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows<br />
      You fight 'em on high and you fight 'em down in<br />
      You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin<br />
      You've got legs that can drive men mad<br />
      A lot of things we didn't do that I wish we had<br />
      In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear<br />
      You'll wish to God that you stayed right here<br />
      <br />
      Set 'em Joe, play &quot;Walkin' the Floor&quot;<br />
      Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore<br />
      I'm staying up late, I'm making amends<br />
      While we smile, all heaven descends<br />
      If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime<br />
      All things are beautiful in their time<br />
      The black and the white, the yellow and the brown<br />
      It's all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town
