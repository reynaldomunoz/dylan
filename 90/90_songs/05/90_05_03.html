    <p>I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind.<br />
      I won't even think about what I left behind<br />
      Nothing back there anyway that I can call my own<br />
      Go back home, leave me alone<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      Ever since the British burned the White House down<br />
      There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town<br />
      I saw you drinking from an empty cup<br />
      I saw you buried and I saw you dug up<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      Look down angel from the skies<br />
      Help my weary soul to rise<br />
      I kissed your cheek, I dragged your plow<br />
      You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now.<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      In the courtyard of the golden sun<br />
      You stand and fight or you break and run<br />
      You went and lost your lovely head<br />
      For a drink of wine and a crust of bread<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      We looted and we plundered on distant shores<br />
      Why is my share not equal to yours?<br />
      Your father left you, your mother too<br />
      Even death has washed it's hands of you<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      This is a hard country to stay alive in<br />
      Blades are everywhere, and they're breaking my skin<br />
      I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard<br />
      You won't get out of here unscarred.<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      You got too many lovers waiting at the wall<br />
      If I had a thousand tongues I couldn't count them all<br />
      Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea<br />
      Today even one may be too much for me<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      Cake walking baby, you could do no wrong<br />
      Put your arms around me where they belong<br />
      I wanna take you on a roller coaster ride<br />
      Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face<br />
      And she has crowned my soul with grace<br />
      I'm still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest<br />
      I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      Been dark all night but now it's dawn<br />
      The moving finger is moving on<br />
      You can guard me while I sleep<br />
      Kiss away the tears I weep<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday<br />
      <br />
      I love women, and she loves men<br />
      We've been to the west and we're going back again<br />
      I heard a voice at the dusk of day<br />
      Saying, &quot;Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray.&quot;<br />
      It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way<br />
      If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday</p>
