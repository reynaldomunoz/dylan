     <p>The pale moon rose in its glory<br />
       Out on the Western town<br />
       She told a sad, sad story<br />
       Of the great ship that went down<br />
       <br />
       It was the fourteenth day of April<br />
       Over the waves she rode<br />
       Sailing into tomorrow<br />
       To a golden age foretold<br />
       <br />
       The night was black with starlight<br />
       The seas were sharp and clear<br />
       Moving through the shadows<br />
       The promised hour was near<br />
       <br />
       Lights were holding steady<br />
       Gliding over the foam<br />
       All the lords and ladies<br />
       Heading for their eternal home<br />
       <br />
       The chandeliers were swaying<br />
       From the balustrades above<br />
       The orchestra was playing<br />
       Songs of faded love<br />
       <br />
       The watchman, he lay dreaming<br />
       As the ballroom dancers twirled<br />
       He dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br />
       Into the underworld<br />
       <br />
       Leo took his sketchbook<br />
       He was often so inclined<br />
       He closed his eyes and painted<br />
       The scenery in his mind<br />
       <br />
       Cupid struck his bosom<br />
       And broke it with a snap<br />
       The closest woman to him<br />
       He fell into her lap<br />
       <br />
       He heard a loud commotion<br />
       Something sounded wrong<br />
       His inner spirit was saying<br />
       That he couldn't stand here long<br />
       <br />
       He staggered to the quarterdeck<br />
       No time now to sleep<br />
       Water on the quarterdeck<br />
       Already three foot deep<br />
       <br />
       Smokestack was leaning sideways<br />
       Heavy feet began to pound<br />
       He walked into the whirlwind<br />
       Sky splitting all around<br />
       <br />
       The ship was going under<br />
       The universe had opened wide<br />
       The roll was called up yonder<br />
       The angels turned aside<br />
       <br />
       Lights down in the hallway<br />
       Flickering dim and dull<br />
       Dead bodies already floating<br />
       In the double bottom hull<br />
       <br />
       The engines then exploded<br />
       Propellers they failed to start<br />
       The boilers overloaded<br />
       The ship's bow split apart<br />
       <br />
       Passengers were flying<br />
       Backward, forward, far and fast<br />
       They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled<br />
       Each one more weary than the last<br />
       <br />
       The veil was torn asunder<br />
       'Tween the hours of twelve and one<br />
       No change, no sudden wonder<br />
       Could undo what had been done<br />
       <br />
       The watchman lay there dreaming<br />
       At forty five degrees<br />
       He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking<br />
       Dropping to her knees<br />
       <br />
       Wellington he was sleeping<br />
       His bed began to slide<br />
       His valiant heart was beating<br />
       He pushed the tables aside<br />
       <br />
       Glass of shattered crystal<br />
       Lay scattered roundabout<br />
       He strapped on both his pistols<br />
       How long could he hold out?<br />
       <br />
       His men and his companions<br />
       Were nowhere to be seen<br />
       In silence there he waited for<br />
       Time and space to intervene<br />
       <br />
       The passageway was narrow<br />
       There was blackness in the air<br />
       He saw every kind of sorrow<br />
       Heard voices everywhere<br />
       <br />
       Alarm-bells were ringing<br />
       To hold back the swelling tide<br />
       Friends and lovers clinging<br />
       To each other side by side<br />
       <br />
       Mothers and their daughters<br />
       Descending down the stairs<br />
       Jumped into the icy waters<br />
       Love and pity sent their prayers<br />
       <br />
       The rich man, Mister Astor<br />
       Kissed his darling wife<br />
       He had no way of knowing<br />
       It'd be the last trip of his life<br />
       <br />
       Calvin, Blake and Wilson<br />
       Gambled in the dark<br />
       Not one of them would ever live to<br />
       Tell the tale on the disembark<br />
       <br />
       Brother rose up 'gainst brother<br />
       In every circumstance<br />
       They fought and slaughtered each other<br />
       In a deadly dance<br />
       <br />
       They lowered down the lifeboats<br />
       From the sinking wreck<br />
       There were traitors, there were turncoats<br />
       Broken backs and broken necks<br />
       <br />
       The bishop left his cabin<br />
       To help others in need<br />
       Turned his eyes up to the heavens<br />
       Said, &quot;The poor are yours to feed&quot;<br />
       <br />
       Davey the brothel-keeper<br />
       Came out dismissed his girls<br />
       Saw the water getting deeper<br />
       Saw the changing of his world<br />
       <br />
       Jim Dandy smiled<br />
       He never learned to swim<br />
       Saw the little crippled child<br />
       And he gave his seat to him<br />
       <br />
       He saw the starlight shining<br />
       Streaming from the East<br />
       Death was on the rampage<br />
       But his heart was now at peace<br />
       <br />
       They battened down the hatches<br />
       But the hatches wouldn't hold<br />
       They drowned upon the staircase<br />
       Of brass and polished gold<br />
       <br />
       Leo said to Cleo<br />
       I think I'm going mad<br />
       But he'd lost his mind already<br />
       Whatever mind he had<br />
       <br />
       He tried to block the doorway<br />
       To save all those from harm<br />
       Blood from an open wound<br />
       Pouring down his arm<br />
       <br />
       Petals fell from flowers<br />
       'Til all of them were gone<br />
       In the long and dreadful hours<br />
       The wizard's curse played on<br />
       <br />
       The host was pouring brandy<br />
       He was going down slow<br />
       He stayed right to the end and he<br />
       Was the last to go<br />
       <br />
       There were many, many others<br />
       Nameless here forever more<br />
       They never sailed the ocean<br />
       Or left their homes before<br />
       <br />
       The watchman, he lay dreaming<br />
       The damage had been done<br />
       He dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br />
       And he tried to tell someone<br />
       <br />
       The captain, barely breathing<br />
       Kneeling at the wheel<br />
       Above him and beneath him<br />
       Fifty thousand tons of steel<br />
       <br />
       He looked over at his compass<br />
       And he gazed into its face<br />
       Needle pointing downward<br />
       He knew he'd lost the race<br />
       <br />
       In the dark illumination<br />
       He remembered bygone years<br />
       He read the Book of Revelation<br />
       And he filled his cup with tears<br />
       <br />
       When the Reaper's task had ended<br />
       Sixteen hundred had gone to rest<br />
       The good, the bad, the rich, the poor<br />
       The loveliest and the best<br />
       <br />
       They waited at the landing<br />
       And they tried to understand<br />
       But there is no understanding<br />
       On the judgment of God's hand<br />
       <br />
       The news came over the wires<br />
       And struck with deadly force<br />
       Love had lost its fires<br />
       All things had run their course<br />
       <br />
       The watchman he lay dreaming<br />
       Of all the things that can be<br />
       He dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br />
       Into the deep blue sea</p>
