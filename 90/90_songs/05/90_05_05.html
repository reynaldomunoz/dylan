    Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure<br />
      Nothing more wretched than what I must endure<br />
      I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun<br />
      I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done<br />
      Sooner or later you make a mistake,<br />
      I'll put you in a chain that you never will break<br />
      Legs and arms and body and bone<br />
      I pay in blood, but not my own.<br />
      <br />
      Night after night, Day after day<br />
      They strip your useless hopes away<br />
      The more I take the more I give<br />
      The more I die the more I live<br />
      I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim<br />
      I got dogs could tear you limb from limb<br />
      I'm circlin' around the Southern Zone<br />
      I pay in blood, but not my own.<br />
      <br />
      Low cards are what I've got<br />
      But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not<br />
      I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God<br />
      You could put me out in front of a firing squad<br />
      I've been out and around with the rising men<br />
      Just like you my handsome friend<br />
      My head's so hard, must be made of stone<br />
      I pay in blood, but not my own.<br />
      <br />
      Another politician pumping out the piss<br />
      Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss<br />
      You got the same eyes that your mother does<br />
      If only you could prove who your father was<br />
      Someone must to slipped a drug in your wine<br />
      You gulped it down and you cross the line<br />
      Man can't live by bread alone<br />
      I pay in blood, but not my own.<br />
      <br />
      How I made it back home, nobody knows<br />
      Or how I survived so many blows<br />
      I've been thru Hell, What good did it do?<br />
      You bastard! I'm supposed to respect you!<br />
      I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse<br />
      Show me your moral virtue first<br />
      Hear me holler and hear me moan<br />
      I pay in blood but not my own.<br />
      <br />
      You get your lover in the bed<br />
      Come here I'll break your lousy head<br />
      Our nation must be saved and freed<br />
      You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?<br />
      This is how I spend my days<br />
      I came to bury, not to praise<br />
      I'll drink my fill and sleep alone<br />
      I play in blood, but not my own.
