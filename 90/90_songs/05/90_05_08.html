       <p>It was late last night when the boss came home<br />
         To wander early his mansion and a desolate throne<br />
         Servant said boss the ladies gone<br />
         She left this morning just before dawn<br />
         <br />
         You got something to tell me, tell it to me man<br />
         Come to the point as straight as you can<br />
         Old henry lee chief of the clan<br />
         Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand<br />
         <br />
         The boss he lay back flat on his bed<br />
         He cursed the heat and he clutched his head<br />
         He pondered the future of his fate<br />
         To wait another day would be far too late<br />
         <br />
         Go fetch me my coat and my tie<br />
         And the cheapest labour that money can buy<br />
         Saddle me up my buckskin mare<br />
         If you see me go by put up a prayer<br />
         <br />
         Well they rode all night and they rode all day<br />
         Eastward long on the broad highway<br />
         His spirit was tired and his vision was bent<br />
         His men deserted him and onward he went<br />
         <br />
         He came to a place where the land was dull<br />
         His poor head pounding in his skull<br />
         Heavy heart was racked with pain<br />
         Insomnia raging in his brain<br />
         <br />
         Well he threw down his helmet and his cross handle sword<br />
         He renounced his faith he denied his lord<br />
         Crawled on his belly put his ear to the wall<br />
         One way or another put an end to it all<br />
         <br />
         He leaned down cut the electric wire<br />
         Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire<br />
         Peered through the darkness caught a glimpse of the two<br />
         Hard to tell for certain who was who<br />
         <br />
         He lowered himself down on a golden chain<br />
         His nerves were quickening every vein<br />
         His knuckles were bloody he sucked in the air<br />
         He ran his fingers through his greasy hair<br />
         <br />
         They looked at each other and their glasses clinked<br />
         One single unit inseparably linked<br />
         Got a strange premonition there's a man close by<br />
         Don't worry about him he wouldn't harm a fly<br />
         <br />
         From behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor<br />
         He moved his feet and he bolted the door<br />
         Shadows hiding the lines in his face<br />
         With all the nobility of an ancient race<br />
         <br />
         She turned she was startled by a look of surprise<br />
         With the hatred that could hit the skies<br />
         You're a reckless fool I could see it in your eyes<br />
         To come this way was by no means wise<br />
         <br />
         Get up stand up you greedy lipped wench<br />
         And cover your face with some other consequence<br />
         You are making my heart feel sick<br />
         Put your clothes on double quick<br />
         <br />
         Sill boy you think me a saint<br />
         To listen no more to your words of complaint<br />
         You've given me nothing but the sweetest lies<br />
         Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes<br />
         <br />
         Id have given you the stars and the planets too<br />
         What good are these things to you<br />
         By the heart if not the knee<br />
         Or never again this world you see<br />
         <br />
         Oh please let not your heart be cold<br />
         This man is dearer to me than gold<br />
         Oh my dear you must be blind<br />
         He's a gutless ape with a worthless mind<br />
         <br />
         You've had your way too long with me<br />
         Now its me who will determine how things will be<br />
         Tried to escape he cussed and cursed<br />
         You'll have to try get passed me first<br />
         <br />
         I dared not let your passion rule<br />
         You think my heart the heart of a fool<br />
         And you sir you can not deny<br />
         You made a monkey of me for what and for why<br />
         <br />
         Ill have no more of this insulting chat<br />
         The devil can have you I'll see to that<br />
         Look sharp or step aside<br />
         Or in the cradle you'll wish you died<br />
         <br />
         The gun went boom and the shot rang clear<br />
         The first bullet grazed his ear<br />
         Second ball went right straight in<br />
         And he bent in the middle like a twisted bin<br />
         <br />
         He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head<br />
         He grabbed the chair and he grabbed the bed<br />
         It would take more than needle and thread<br />
         Bleeding from the mouth he's as good as dead<br />
         <br />
         You shot my husband down you fiend<br />
         Husband what, husband what the hell do you mean<br />
         He was man of strife a man of sin<br />
         I cut him down and I throw him to the wind<br />
         <br />
         Hear this she said with angry breath<br />
         You too shall meet the lord of death<br />
         It was I who brought your soul to life<br />
         And she raised her robe and she drew out a knife<br />
         <br />
         His face was hard and caked with sweat<br />
         His arms ached and his hands were wet<br />
         You're a murderous woman and bloody wife<br />
         If you don't mind ill have the knife<br />
         <br />
         We're two of a kind and our blood runs hot<br />
         But we're no way similar in body or thought<br />
         All husbands are good men is all I knew<br />
         Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow<br />
         <br />
         His knees went limp and he reached for the door<br />
         His doom was sealed he slipped to the floor<br />
         He whispered in her ear this is all your fault<br />
         My fighting days have come to a halt<br />
         <br />
         She touched his lips and kissed his cheek<br />
         He tried to speak but his breath was weak<br />
         You die for me I will die for you<br />
         She put the blade to her heart and she ran it though<br />
         <br />
         All three lovers together in a heap<br />
         Thrown into the grave forever to sleep<br />
         Funeral torches blazed away<br />
         Through the towns and the villages all night and all day     </p>
