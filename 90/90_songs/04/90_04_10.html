    <p>Talk about me babe, if you must<br />
      Throw on the dirt, pile on the dust<br />
      I'd do the same thing if I could<br />
      You know what they say, they say it's all good<br />
      All good<br />
      It's all good</p>
    <p>Big politician telling lies<br />
      Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies<br />
      Don't make a bit of difference, don't see why it should<br />
      But it's all right, 'cause it's all good<br />
      It's all good<br />
      It's all good</p>
    <p>Wives are leavin' their husbands, they beginning to roam<br />
      They leave the party and they never get home<br />
      I wouldn't change it, even if I could<br />
      You know what they say man, it's all good<br />
      It's all good<br />
      All good</p>
    <p>Brick by brick, they tear you down<br />
      A teacup of water is enough to drown<br />
      You ought to know, if they could they would<br />
      Whatever going down, it's all good<br />
      All good<br />
      Say it's all good</p>
    <p>People in the country, people on the land<br />
      Some of them so sick, they can hardly stand<br />
      Everybody would move away, if they could<br />
      It's hard to believe but it's all good<br />
      Yeah</p>
    <p>The widow's cry, the orphan's plea<br />
      Everywhere you look, more misery<br />
      Come along with me, babe, I wish you would<br />
      You know what I'm sayin', it's all good<br />
      All good<br />
      I said it's all good<br />
      All good</p>
    <p>Cold-blooded killer, stalking the town<br />
      Cop cars blinking, something bad going down<br />
      Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood<br />
      But there's nothing to worry about, 'cause it's all good<br />
      It's all good<br />
      They say it's all good</p>
    <p>I'll pluck off your beard and blow it in your face<br />
      This time tomorrow I'll be rolling in your place<br />
      I wouldn't change a thing even if I could<br />
      You know what they say, they say it's all good<br />
      It's all good</p>
