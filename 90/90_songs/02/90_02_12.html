    <p>I got my back to the sun &rsquo;cause the light is too intense<br />
      I can see what everybody in the world is up against<br />
      You can&rsquo;t turn back—you can&rsquo;t come back, sometimes we push too far<br />
      One day you&rsquo;ll open up your eyes and you&rsquo;ll see where we are</p>
    <p>Sugar Baby get on down the road<br />
      You ain&rsquo;t got no brains, no how<br />
      You went years without me<br />
      Might as well keep going now</p>
    <p>Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff<br />
      Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide &rsquo;em bad enough<br />
      I&rsquo;m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she&rsquo;s not really my aunt<br />
      Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can&rsquo;t</p>
    <p>Sugar Baby get on down the line<br />
      You ain&rsquo;t got no brains, no how<br />
      You went years without me<br />
      You might as well keep going now</p>
    <p>The ladies down in Darktown, they&rsquo;re doing the Darktown Strut<br />
      You always got to be prepared but you never know for what<br />
      There ain&rsquo;t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring<br />
      Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love&rsquo;s not an evil thing</p>
    <p>Sugar Baby, get on down the road<br />
      You ain&rsquo;t got no brains, no how<br />
      You went years without me<br />
      You might as well keep going now</p>
    <p>Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick<br />
      Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick<br />
      Any minute of the day the bubble could burst<br />
      Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse</p>
    <p>Sugar Baby, get on down the road<br />
      You ain&rsquo;t got no brains, no how<br />
      You went years without me<br />
      Might as well keep going now</p>
    <p>Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one<br />
      You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done<br />
      Just as sure as we&rsquo;re living, just as sure as you&rsquo;re born<br />
      Look up, look up—seek your Maker—&rsquo;fore Gabriel blows his horn</p>
    <p>Sugar Baby, get on down the line<br />
      You ain&rsquo;t got no sense, no how<br />
      You went years without me<br />
      Might as well keep going now</p>
