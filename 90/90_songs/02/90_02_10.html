    <p>Man comes to the door—I say, &ldquo;For whom are you looking?&rdquo;<br />
      He says, &ldquo;Your wife,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s busy in the kitchen cookin&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
      Poor boy—where you been?<br />
      I already tol&rsquo; you—won&rsquo;t tell you again</p>
    <p>I say, &ldquo;How much you want for that?&rdquo; I go into the store<br />
      The man says, &ldquo;Three dollars.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Will you take four?&rdquo;<br />
      Poor boy—never say die<br />
      Things will be all right by and by</p>
    <p>Been workin&rsquo; on the mainline—workin&rsquo; like the devil<br />
      The game is the same—it&rsquo;s just on a different level<br />
      Poor boy—dressed in black<br />
      Police at your back</p>
    <p>Poor boy in a red hot town<br />
      Out beyond the twinklin&rsquo; stars<br />
      Ridin&rsquo; first-class trains—making the rounds<br />
      Tryin&rsquo; to keep from fallin&rsquo; between the cars</p>
    <p>Othello told Desdemona, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold, cover me with a blanket<br />
      By the way, what happened to that poison wine?&rdquo;<br />
      She says, &ldquo;I gave it to you, you drank it&rdquo;<br />
      Poor boy, layin&rsquo; &rsquo;em straight—pickin&rsquo; up the cherries fallin&rsquo; off the plate</p>
    <p>Time and love has branded me with its claws<br />
      Had to go to Florida, dodgin&rsquo; them Georgia laws<br />
      Poor boy, in the hotel called the Palace of Gloom<br />
      Calls down to room service, says send up a room</p>
    <p>My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer<br />
      My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him<br />
      When my mother died, my uncle took me in—he ran a funeral parlor<br />
      He did a lot of nice things for me and I won&rsquo;t forget him</p>
    <p>All I know is that I&rsquo;m thrilled by your kiss<br />
      I don&rsquo;t know any more than this<br />
      Poor boy, pickin&rsquo; up sticks<br />
      Build ya a house out of mortar and bricks</p>
    <p>Knockin&rsquo; on the door, I say, &ldquo;Who is it and where are you from?&rdquo;<br />
      Man says, &ldquo;Freddy!&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Freddy who?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Freddy or not here I come&rdquo;<br />
      Poor boy &rsquo;neath the stars that shine<br />
      Washin&rsquo; them dishes, feedin&rsquo; them swine</p>
