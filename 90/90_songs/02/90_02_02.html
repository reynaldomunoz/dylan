    <p>Every step of the way we walk the line<br />
      Your days are numbered, so are mine<br />
      Time is pilin&rsquo; up, we struggle and we scrape<br />
      We&rsquo;re all boxed in, nowhere to escape</p>
    <p>City&rsquo;s just a jungle; more games to play<br />
      Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away<br />
      I was raised in the country, I been workin&rsquo; in the town<br />
      I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down</p>
    <p>Got nothin' for you, I had nothin' before<br />
      Don&rsquo;t even have anything for myself anymore<br />
      Sky full of fire, pain pourin&rsquo; down<br />
      Nothing you can sell me, I&rsquo;ll see you around</p>
    <p>All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime<br />
      Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme<br />
      Only one thing I did wrong<br />
      Stayed in Mississippi a day too long</p>
    <p>Well, the devil&rsquo;s in the alley, mule&rsquo;s in the stall<br />
      Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all<br />
      I was thinkin&rsquo; 'bout the things that Rosie said<br />
      I was dreaming I was sleepin' in Rosie&rsquo;s bed</p>
    <p>Walkin' through the leaves, falling from the trees<br />
      Feelin' like a stranger nobody sees<br />
      So many things that we never will undo<br />
      I know you&rsquo;re sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry too</p>
    <p>Some people will offer you their hand and some won&rsquo;t<br />
      Last night I knew you, tonight I don&rsquo;t<br />
      I need somethin&rsquo; strong to distract my mind<br />
      I&rsquo;m gonna look at you &rsquo;til my eyes go blind</p>
    <p>Well I got here followin' the southern star<br />
      I crossed that river just to be where you are<br />
      Only one thing I did wrong<br />
      Stayed in Mississippi a day too long</p>
    <p>Well my ship&rsquo;s been split to splinters and it&rsquo;s sinkin' fast<br />
      I&rsquo;m drownin&rsquo; in the poison, got no future, got no past<br />
      But my heart is not weary, it&rsquo;s light and it&rsquo;s free<br />
      I&rsquo;ve got nothin&rsquo; but affection for all those who&rsquo;ve sailed with me</p>
    <p>Everybody movin&rsquo; if they ain&rsquo;t already there<br />
      Everybody got to move somewhere<br />
      Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow<br />
      Things should start to get interestin' right about now</p>
    <p>My clothes are wet, tight on my skin<br />
      Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in<br />
      I know that fortune is waitin&rsquo; to be kind<br />
      So give me your hand and say you&rsquo;ll be mine</p>
    <p>Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay<br />
      You can always come back, but you can&rsquo;t come back all the way<br />
      Only one thing I did wrong<br />
      Stayed in Mississippi a day too long</p>
