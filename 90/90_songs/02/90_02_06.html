    <p>Down over the window<br />
      Comes the dazzling sunlit rays<br />
      Through the back alleys—through the blinds<br />
      Another one of them endless days</p>
    <p>Honey bees are buzzin&rsquo;<br />
      Leaves begin to stir<br />
      I&rsquo;m in love with my second cousin<br />
      I tell myself I could be happy forever with her</p>
    <p>I keep listenin&rsquo; for footsteps<br />
      But I ain&rsquo;t hearing any<br />
      From the boat I fish for bullheads<br />
      I catch a lot, sometimes too many</p>
    <p>A summer breeze is blowing<br />
      A squall is settin&rsquo; in<br />
      Sometimes it&rsquo;s just plain stupid<br />
      To get into any kind of wind</p>
    <p>The old men &rsquo;round here, sometimes they get<br />
      On bad terms with the younger men<br />
      But old, young, age don&rsquo;t carry weight<br />
      It doesn&rsquo;t matter in the end</p>
    <p>One of the boss&rsquo; hangers-on<br />
      Comes to call at times you least expect<br />
      Try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear<br />
      It has the opposite effect</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town<br />
      The old one is long gone<br />
      Timber two-foot-six across<br />
      Burns with the bark still on</p>
    <p>They say times are hard, if you don&rsquo;t believe it<br />
      You can just follow your nose<br />
      It don&rsquo;t bother me—times are hard everywhere<br />
      We&rsquo;ll just have to see how it goes</p>
    <p>My old man, he&rsquo;s like some feudal lord<br />
      Got more lives than a cat<br />
      Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once<br />
      Things come alive or they fall flat</p>
    <p>You can smell the pinewood burnin&rsquo;<br />
      You can hear the school bell ring<br />
      Gotta get up near the teacher if you can<br />
      If you wanna learn anything</p>
    <p>Romeo, he said to Juliet, &ldquo;You got a poor complexion<br />
      It doesn&rsquo;t give your appearance a very youthful touch!&rdquo;<br />
      Juliet said back to Romeo, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just shove off<br />
      If it bothers you so much&rdquo;</p>
    <p>They all got out of here any way they could<br />
      The cold rain can give you the shivers<br />
      They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee<br />
      All the rest of them rebel rivers</p>
    <p>If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again<br />
      You do so at the peril of your own life<br />
      I&rsquo;m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound<br />
      I&rsquo;ve seen enough heartaches and strife</p>
    <p>My grandfather was a duck trapper<br />
      He could do it with just dragnets and ropes<br />
      My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth<br />
      I don&rsquo;t know if they had any dreams or hopes</p>
    <p>I had &rsquo;em once though, I suppose, to go along<br />
      With all the ring-dancin&rsquo; Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves<br />
      I left all my dreams and hopes<br />
      Buried under tobacco leaves</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s not always easy kicking someone out<br />
      Gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task<br />
      Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up<br />
      And tears or not, it&rsquo;s too much to ask</p>
