    <p>There's an evenin' haze settlin' over the town<br />
      Starlight by the edge of the creek<br />
      The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down<br />
      Money's gettin' shallow and weak<br />
      The place I love best is a sweet memory<br />
      It's a new path that we trod<br />
      They say low wages are a reality<br />
      If we want to compete abroad</p>
    <p>My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf<br />
      Come sit down on my knee<br />
      You are dearer to me than myself<br />
      As you yourself can see<br />
      I'm listenin' to the steel rails hum<br />
      Got both eyes tight shut<br />
      Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from<br />
      Creeping it's way into my gut</p>
    <p>Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind<br />
      Bring me my boots and shoes<br />
      You can hang back or fight your best on the front line<br />
      Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues</p>
    <p>Now, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul<br />
      Tossed by the winds and the seas<br />
      I'll drag &lsquo;em all down to hell and I'll stand &lsquo;em at the wall<br />
      I'll sell &lsquo;em to their enemies<br />
      I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought<br />
      Gonna sleep off the rest of the day<br />
      Sometimes no one wants what we got<br />
      Sometimes you can't give it away</p>
    <p>Now the place is ringed with countless foes<br />
      Some of them may be deaf and dumb<br />
      No man, no woman knows<br />
      The hour that sorrow will come<br />
      In the dark I hear the night birds call<br />
      I can hear a lover's breath<br />
      I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall<br />
      Sleep is like a temporary death</p>
    <p>Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind<br />
      Bring me my boots and shoes<br />
      You can hang back or fight your best on the front line<br />
      Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues</p>
    <p>Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse<br />
      I can't save a dime<br />
      I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced<br />
      Into a life of continual crime<br />
      I can see for myself that the sun is sinking<br />
      How I wish you were here to see<br />
      Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking<br />
      That you have forgotten me?</p>
    <p>Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret<br />
      They waste your nights and days<br />
      Them I will forget<br />
      But you I'll remember always<br />
      Old memories of you to me have clung<br />
      You've wounded me with words<br />
      Gonna have to straighten out your tongue<br />
      It's all true, everything you have heard</p>
    <p>Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind<br />
      Bring me my boots and shoes<br />
      You can hang back or fight your best on the front line<br />
      Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues</p>
    <p>In you, my friend, I find no blame<br />
      Wanna look in my eyes, please do<br />
      No one can ever claim<br />
      That I took up arms against you<br />
      All across the peaceful sacred fields<br />
      They will lay you low<br />
      They'll break your horns and slash you with steel<br />
      I say it so it must be so</p>
    <p>Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue<br />
      Gonna give you another chance<br />
      I'm all alone and I'm expecting you<br />
      To lead me off in a cheerful dance<br />
      Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife<br />
      I can live on rice and beans<br />
      Some people never worked a day in their life<br />
      Don't know what work even means</p>
    <p>Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind<br />
      Bring me my boots and shoes<br />
      You can hang back or fight your best on the front line<br />
      Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues</p>
