    <p>Lost John sitting on a railroad track<br />
      Something's out of wack<br />
      Blues this morning falling down like hail<br />
      Gonna leave a greasy trail</p>
    <p>Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do<br />
      Then come back and see you<br />
      All I ever do is struggle and strive<br />
      If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive</p>
    <p>I'm the oldest son of a crazy man<br />
      I'm in a cowboy band<br />
      Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide<br />
      I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side</p>
    <p>Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore<br />
      And my happiness is o'er<br />
      Winter's gone, the river's on the rise<br />
      I loved you then and ever shall<br />
      But there's no one here that's left to tell<br />
      The world has gone black before my eyes</p>
    <p>The world of research has gone berserk<br />
      Too much paperwork<br />
      Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell<br />
      I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell</p>
    <p>I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog<br />
      Get away from these demagogues<br />
      And these bad luck women stick like glue<br />
      It's either one or the other or neither of the two</p>
    <p>She says, &quot;look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants.<br />
      You can get wrecked in this dance.&quot;<br />
      They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will<br />
      I'm riding with you to the top of the hill</p>
    <p>Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore<br />
      And my happiness is o'er<br />
      Winter's gone, the river's on the rise<br />
      I loved you then and ever shall<br />
      But there's no one here that's left to tell<br />
      The world has gone black before my eyes</p>
    <p>Don't know why my baby never looked so good before<br />
      I don't have to wonder no more<br />
      She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night<br />
      I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite</p>
    <p>The Judge is coming in, everybody rise<br />
      Lift up your eyes<br />
      You can do what you please, you don't need my advice<br />
      Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice</p>
    <p>Getting light outside, the temperature dropped<br />
      I think the rain has stopped<br />
      I'm going to make you come to grips with fate<br />
      When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight</p>
    <p>Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore<br />
      And my happiness is o'er<br />
      Winter's gone, the river's on the rise<br />
      I loved you then and ever shall<br />
      But there's no one here that's left to tell<br />
      The world has gone black before my eyes</p>
    <p>The bright spark of the steady lights<br />
      Has dimmed my sights<br />
      When you're around all my grief gives 'way<br />
      A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day</p>
    <p>Everything I've ever known to be right has proven wrong<br />
      I'll be drifting along<br />
      The woman I'm lovin', she rules my heart<br />
      No knife could ever cut our love apart</p>
    <p>Today I'll stand in faith and raise<br />
      The voice of praise<br />
      The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light<br />
      I wish to God that it were night</p>
    <p>Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore<br />
      And my happiness is o'er<br />
      Winter's gone, the river's on the rise<br />
      I loved you then and ever shall<br />
      But there's no one here that's left to tell<br />
      The world has gone black before my eyes</p>
