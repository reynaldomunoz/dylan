    <p>Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon<br />
      There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon<br />
      Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow<br />
      Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go</p>
    <p>I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying<br />
      When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line<br />
      I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be<br />
      I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee</p>
    <p>Feel like my soul is beginning to expand<br />
      Look into my heart and you will sort of understand<br />
      You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away<br />
      The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say</p>
    <p>Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum<br />
      Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from<br />
      I don't need any guide, I already know the way<br />
      Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day</p>
    <p>The pistols are poppin' and the power is down<br />
      I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town<br />
      The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed<br />
      Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need</p>
    <p>I've been sitting down studying the art of love<br />
      I think it will fit me like a glove<br />
      I want some real good woman to do just what I say<br />
      Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today</p>
    <p>Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground<br />
      Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down<br />
      Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king<br />
      I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing</p>
    <p>Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches<br />
      I'll recruit my army from the orphanages<br />
      I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows<br />
      I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows</p>
    <p>I got the porkchops, she got the pie<br />
      She ain't no angel and neither am I<br />
      Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes<br />
      I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams</p>
    <p>Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be<br />
      Mean old twister bearing down on me<br />
      All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town<br />
      Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down</p>
    <p>Everybody's going and I want to go too<br />
      Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new<br />
      I did all I could and I did it right there and then<br />
      I've already confessed – no need to confess again</p>
    <p>Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north<br />
      I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth<br />
      The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf<br />
      For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself</p>
