    <p>As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden<br />
      The wounded flowers were dangling from the vines<br />
      I was passing by yon cool and crystal fountain<br />
      Someone hit me from behind</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      Through this weary world of woe<br />
      Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
      No one on earth would ever know</p>
    <p>They say prayer has the power to help<br />
      So pray from the mother<br />
      In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell<br />
      I'm trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others<br />
      But oh, mother, things ain't going well</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      I'll burn that bridge before you can cross<br />
      Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
      They'll be no mercy for you once you've lost</p>
    <p>Now I'm all worn down by weepin'<br />
      My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry<br />
      If I catch my opponents ever sleepin'<br />
      I'll just slaughter them where they lie</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      Through the world mysterious and vague<br />
      Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
      Walking through the cities of the plague</p>
    <p>The whole world is filled with speculation<br />
      The whole wide world which people say is round<br />
      They will tear your mind away from contemplation<br />
      They will jump on your misfortune when you're down</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      Eatin' hog-eyed grease in hog-eyed town<br />
      Heart burnin' – still yearnin'<br />
      Someday you'll be glad to have me around</p>
    <p>They will crush you with wealth and power<br />
      Every waking moment you could crack<br />
      I'll make the most of one last extra hour<br />
      I'll avenge my father's death then I'll step back</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      Hand me down my walkin' cane<br />
      Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
      Got to get you out of my miserable brain</p>
    <p>All my loyal and much-loved companions<br />
      They approve of me and share my code<br />
      I practice a faith that's been long abandoned<br />
      Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      My mule is sick, my horse is blind<br />
      Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
      Thinkin' &lsquo;bout that gal I left behind</p>
    <p>It's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying<br />
      Fame and honor never seem to fade<br />
      The fire's gone out but the light is never dying<br />
      Who says I can't get heavenly aid?</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      Carrying a dead man's shield<br />
      Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
      Walkin' with a toothache in my heel</p>
    <p>The suffering is unending<br />
      Every nook and cranny has its tears<br />
      I'm not playing, I'm not pretending<br />
      I'm not nursing any superfluous fears</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      Walkin' ever since the other night<br />
      Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
      Walkin' &lsquo;til I'm clean out of sight</p>
    <p>As I walked out in the mystic garden<br />
      On a hot summer day, hot summer lawn<br />
      Excuse me, ma'am I beg your pardon<br />
      There's no one here, the gardener is gone</p>
    <p>Ain't talkin', just walkin'<br />
      Up the road around the bend<br />
      Heart burnin', still yearnin'<br />
      In the last outback, at the world's end</p>
