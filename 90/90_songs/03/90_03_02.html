    <p>Spirit on the water<br />
      Darkness on the face of the deep<br />
      I keep thinking about you baby<br />
      I can't hardly sleep</p>
    <p>I'm traveling by land<br />
      Traveling through the dawn of day<br />
      You're always on my mind<br />
      I can't stay away</p>
    <p>I'd forgotten about you<br />
      Then you turned up again<br />
      I always knew<br />
      That we were meant to be more than friends</p>
    <p>When you are near<br />
      It's just as plain as it can be<br />
      I'm wild about you, gal<br />
      You ought to be a fool about me</p>
    <p>Can't explain<br />
      The sources of this hidden pain<br />
      You burned your way into my heart<br />
      You got the key to my brain</p>
    <p>I've been trampling through mud<br />
      Praying to the powers above<br />
      I'm sweating blood<br />
      You got a face that begs for love</p>
    <p>Life without you<br />
      Doesn't mean a thing to me<br />
      If I can't have you,<br />
      I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea</p>
    <p>Sometimes I wonder<br />
      Why you can't treat me right<br />
      You do good all day<br />
      Then you do wrong all night</p>
    <p>When you're with me<br />
      I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say<br />
      What does it matter<br />
      What price I pay</p>
    <p>They brag about your sugar<br />
      Brag about it all over town<br />
      Put some sugar in my bowl<br />
      I feel like laying down</p>
    <p>I'm pale as a ghost<br />
      Holding a blossom on a stem<br />
      You ever seen a ghost? No<br />
      But you have heard of them</p>
    <p>I see you there<br />
      I'm blinded by the colors I see<br />
      I take good care<br />
      Of what belongs to me</p>
    <p>I hear your name<br />
      Ringing up and down the line<br />
      I'm saying it plain<br />
      These ties are strong enough to bind</p>
    <p>Your sweet voice<br />
      Calls out from some old familiar shrine<br />
      I got no choice<br />
      Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind</p>
    <p>I could live forever<br />
      With you perfectly<br />
      You don't ever<br />
      Have to make a fuss over me</p>
    <p>From East to West<br />
      Ever since the world began<br />
      I only mean it for the best<br />
      I want to be with you any way I can</p>
    <p>I been in a brawl<br />
      Now I'm feeling the wall<br />
      I'm going away baby<br />
      I won't be back &lsquo;til fall</p>
    <p>High on the hill<br />
      You can carry all my thoughts with you<br />
      You've numbed my will<br />
      This love could tear me in two</p>
    <p>I wanna be with you in paradise<br />
      And it seems so unfair<br />
      I can't go to paradise no more<br />
      I killed a man back there</p>
    <p>You think I'm over the hill<br />
      You think I'm past my prime<br />
      Let me see what you got<br />
      We can have a whoppin' good time</p>
